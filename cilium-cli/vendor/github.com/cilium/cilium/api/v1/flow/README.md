<a name="flow-Verdict"></a>

### Verdict


| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| VERDICT_UNKNOWN | 0 | UNKNOWN is used if there is no verdict for this flow event |
| FORWARDED | 1 | FORWARDED is used for flow events where the trace point has forwarded this packet or connection to the next processing entity. |
| DROPPED | 2 | DROPPED is used for flow events where the connection or packet has been dropped (e.g. due to a malformed packet, it being rejected by a network policy etc). The exact drop reason may be found in drop_reason_desc. |
| ERROR | 3 | ERROR is used for flow events where an error occurred during processing |
| AUDIT | 4 | AUDIT is used on policy verdict events in policy audit mode, to denominate flows that would have been dropped by policy if audit mode was turned off |
| REDIRECTED | 5 | REDIRECTED is used for flow events which have been redirected to the proxy |
| TRACED | 6 | TRACED is used for flow events which have been observed at a trace point, but no particular verdict has been reached yet |
| TRANSLATED | 7 | TRANSLATED is used for flow events where an address has been translated |
