	// CurryWith returns a vector curried with the provided labels, i.e. the

	// on it. The cardinality of the curried vector is reduced accordingly. The
	// order of the remaining labels stays the same (just with the curried labels
	// taken out of the sequence â€“ which is relevant for the
	// (GetMetric)WithLabelValues methods). It is possible to curry a curried
	// vector, but only with labels not yet used for currying before.
	//
	// The metrics contained in the `Vec[T]` are shared between the curried and
	// uncurried vectors. They are just accessed differently. Curried and uncurried
	// vectors behave identically in terms of collection. Only one must be
	// registered with a given registry (usually the uncurried version). The Reset
	// method deletes all metrics, even if called on a curried vector.

	// GetMetricWith returns the `T` for the given Labels map (the label names
	// must match those of the variable labels in Desc). If that label map is

	// creating a `T` without using it and keeping the `T` for later use are
	// the same as for GetMetricWithLabelValues.

	// An error is returned if the number and names of the Labels are inconsistent
	// with those of the variable labels in Desc (minus any curried labels).

	// This method is used for the same purpose as

	// It is possible to call this method without using the returned `T` to only
	// create the new `T` but leave it at its starting value 0.
	//
	// Keeping the `T` for later use is possible (and should be considered if
	// performance is critical), but keep in mind that Reset, DeleteLabelValues and
	// Delete can be used to delete the `T` from the `Vec[T]`, assuming it also
	// implements `DeletableVec[T]`. In that case,
	// the `T` will still exist, but it will not be exported anymore, even if a
	// `T` with the same label values is created later.

	// number of variable labels in Desc (minus any curried labels).

	// caused by an incorrect order of arguments. Consider GetMetricWith(Labels) as
	// an alternative to avoid that type of mistake. For higher label numbers, the
	// latter has a much more readable (albeit more verbose) syntax, but it comes
	// with a performance overhead (for creating and processing the Labels map).
