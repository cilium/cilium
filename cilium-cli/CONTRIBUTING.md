# Contributing to Cilium CLI

## IMPORTANT Cilium CLI is moving ðŸššðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦

We are planning to merge Cilium CLI code into cilium/cilium repository to
simplify the overall development process after Cilium v1.16.0 gets released.
See [CFP-25694](https://github.com/cilium/design-cfps/pull/9) for details.
If you have questions, post a message in
[#development Cilium Slack channel](https://cilium.slack.com/archives/C2B917YHE).

## Contribution workflow

Cilium CLI uses GitHub for collaborative development. Please use GitHub issues
to discuss proposals and use pull requests to suggest changes. For more
information see the [Cilium Development
Guide](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/contributing/development/).

## Slack

Most developers are using the [Cilium & eBPF
Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack) to communicate
outside of GitHub.

## Code of conduct

All members of the Cilium community must abide by the [Cilium Community Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Only
by respecting each other can we develop a productive, collaborative community.
If you would like to report a violation of the code of contact, please contact
any of the maintainers or our mediator, Beatriz Martinez <beatriz@cilium.io>.
