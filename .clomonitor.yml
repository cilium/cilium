exemptions:
  - check: slack_presence
    reason: "The Cilium slack community can be found at https://slack.cilium.io" # Justification of this exemption

  - check: dangerous_workflow
    reason: >
      "It is safe to run code checkout '${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}' 
      and 'github.event.pull_request.head.ref' in .github/workflows/build-images-base.yaml 
      as this workflow is only permitted to be executed after an explicit approval of a 
      subset of committers."

  - check: signed_releases
    reason: >
      "All Cilium release images are cryptographically signed during build by cosign. 
      Images are hosted in Quay. OpenSSF Scorecard check is currently limited to repositories 
      hosted on GitHub, and does not support other source hosting repositories."

  - check: token_permissions
    reason: >
      "Reason to use every non-read-only token in GitHub workflows is commented in the respective workflow files."
