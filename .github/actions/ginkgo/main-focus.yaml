# This file contains the list of tests that should be included and excluded.
#
# To provide a better UX, the 'cliFocus' defined on each element from the
#  "include" is expanded to the specific defined 'focus'. This way we can map
#  which regex should be used on ginkgo --focus to an element from the "focus"
#  list.
#
# Further down is a list of tests that can be excluded because they are ignored
# by our constraints defined in the ginkgo tests. There is a justification, in
# form of a comment, explaining why each test is excluded.
