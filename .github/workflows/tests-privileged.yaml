  ### FOR TESTING PURPOSES
  # This workflow runs in the context of `master`, and ignores changes to
  # workflow files in PRs. For testing changes to this workflow from a PR:
  # - Make sure the PR uses a branch from the base repository (requires write
  #   privileges). It will not work with a branch from a fork (missing secrets).
  # - Uncomment the `pull_request` event below, commit separately with a `DO
  #   NOT MERGE` message, and push to the PR. As long as the commit is present,
  #   any push to the PR will trigger this workflow.
  # - Don't forget to remove the `DO NOT MERGE` commit once satisfied. The run
  #   will disappear from the PR checks: please provide a direct link to the
  #   successful workflow run (can be found from Actions tab) in a comment.
  #
  # pull_request: {}
  ###

# By specifying the access of one of the scopes, all of those that are not
# specified are set to 'none'.
permissions:
  # To be able to access the repository with actions/checkout

  # To allow retrieving information from the PR API

  statuses: write

concurrency:
  # Structure:
  # - Workflow name
  # - Event type
  # - A unique identifier depending on event type:
  #   - schedule: SHA
  #   - issue_comment: PR number
  #   - pull_request: PR number
  #
  # This structure ensures a unique concurrency group name is generated for each
  # type of testing:
  # - schedule: {name} schedule {SHA}
  # - issue_comment: {name} issue_comment {PR number}
  # - pull_request: {name} pull_request {PR number}
  #
  # Note: for `issue_comment` triggers, we additionally need to filter out based
  # on comment content, otherwise any comment will interrupt workflow runs.
