## Cilium Feature Proposal
        
Thanks for taking time to make a feature proposal for Cilium! If you have usage questions, please try the [slack channel](http://slack.cilium.io/) and see the [FAQ](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:issue+label:kind/question+) first.

**Is your proposed feature related to a problem?**

If so, please describe the problem

**Describe the feature you'd like**

Include any specific requirements you need

**(Optional) Describe your proposed solution**

Please complete this section if you have ideas / suggestions on how to implement the feature. We strongly recommend discussing your approach with Cilium committers before spending lots of time implementing a change. 

For longer proposals, you are welcome to link to an external doc (e.g. a Google doc). We have a [Cilium Feature Proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vtE82JExQHw8_-pX2Uhq5acN1BMPxNlS6cMQUezRTWg/edit) to help you structure your proposal - if you would like to use it, please make a copy and ensure it's publicly visible, and then add the link here.

Once the CFP is close to being finalized, please add it as a PR to the [design-cfps](https://github.com/cilium/design-cfps) repo for final approval.
