Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based
dataplane. It provides a simple flat Layer 3 network with the ability to span
multiple clusters in either a native routing or overlay mode. It is L7-protocol
aware and can enforce network policies on L3-L7 using an identity based security
model that is decoupled from network addressing.

Cilium implements distributed load balancing for traffic between pods and to
external services, and is able to fully replace kube-proxy, using efficient
hash tables in eBPF allowing for almost unlimited scale. It also supports
advanced functionality like integrated ingress and egress gateway, bandwidth
management and service mesh, and provides deep network and security visibility and monitoring.

A new Linux kernel technology called eBPF_ is at the foundation of Cilium. It
supports dynamic insertion of eBPF bytecode into the Linux kernel at various
integration points such as: network IO, application sockets, and tracepoints to
implement security, networking and visibility logic. eBPF is highly efficient
and flexible. To learn more about eBPF, visit `eBPF.io`_.

Functionality Overview
======================

.. begin-functionality-overview

CNI (Container Network Interface)
---------------------------------

`Cilium as a CNI plugin <https://cilium.io/use-cases/cni/>`_ provides a
fast, scalable, and secure networking layer for Kubernetes clusters. Built
on eBPF, it offers several deployment options:

* **Overlay networking:** encapsulation-based virtual network spanning all
  hosts with support for VXLAN and Geneve. It works on almost any network
  infrastructure as the only requirement is IP connectivity between hosts
  which is typically already given.

* **Native routing mode:** Use of the regular routing table of the Linux
  host. The network is required to be capable of routing the IP addresses
  of the application containers. It integrates with cloud routers, routing
  daemons, and IPv6-native infrastructure.

* **Flexible routing options:** Cilium can automate route learning and
  advertisement in common topologies such as using L2 neighbor discovery
  when nodes share a layer 2 domain, or BGP when routing across layer 3
  boundaries.

Each mode is designed for maximum interoperability with existing
infrastructure while minimizing operational burden.

Load Balancing
--------------

Cilium implements distributed load balancing for traffic between application
containers and to/from external services. The load balancing is implemented
in eBPF using efficient hashtables enabling high service density and low
latency at scale.

* **East-west load balancing** rewrites service connections at the socket
  level (``connect()``), avoiding the overhead of per-packet NAT and fully
  `replacing kube-proxy <https://cilium.io/use-cases/kube-proxy/>`_.

* **North-south load balancing** supports XDP for high-throughput scenarios
  and `layer 4 load balancing <https://cilium.io/use-cases/load-balancer/>`_
  including Direct Server Return (DSR), and Maglev consistent hashing.

Cluster Mesh
------------

Cilium `Cluster Mesh <https://cilium.io/use-cases/cluster-mesh/>`_ enables
secure, seamless connectivity across multiple Kubernetes clusters. For
operators running hybrid or multi-cloud environments, Cluster Mesh ensures
a consistent security and connectivity experience.

* **Global service discovery**: Workloads across clusters can discover and
  connect to services as if they were local. This enables fault tolerance,
  like automatically failing over to backends in another cluster, and
  exposes shared services like logging, auth, or databases across
  environments.

* **Unified identity model:** Security policies are enforced based on
  identity, not IP address, across all clusters.

Network Policy
--------------

Cilium `Network Policy <https://cilium.io/use-cases/network-policy/>`_
provides identity-aware enforcement across L3-L7. Typical container
firewalls secure workloads by filtering on source IP addresses and
destination ports. This concept requires the firewalls on all servers to be
manipulated whenever a container is started anywhere in the cluster.

In order to avoid this situation which limits scale, Cilium assigns a
security identity to groups of application containers which share identical
security policies. The identity is then associated with all network packets
emitted by the application containers, allowing to validate the identity at
the receiving node.

* **Identity-based security** removes reliance on brittle IP addresses.

* **L3/L4 policies** restrict traffic based on labels, protocols, and ports.

* **DNS-based policies:** Allow or deny traffic to FQDNs or wildcard domains
   (e.g., ``api.example.com``, ``*.trusted.com``). This is especially useful
   for securing egress traffic to third-party services.

* **L7-aware policies** allow filtering by HTTP method, URL path, gRPC call,
  and more:

  * Example: Allow only GET requests to ``/public/.*``.

  * Enforce the presence of headers like ``X-Token: [0-9]+``.

CIDR-based egress and ingress policies are also supported for controlling
access to external IPs, ideal for integrating with legacy systems or
regulatory boundaries.

Service Mesh
------------

With Cilium `Service Mesh <https://cilium.io/use-cases/service-mesh/>`_,
operators gain the benefits of fine-grained traffic control, encryption, observability,
access control, without the cost and complexity of traditional proxy-based
designs. Key features include:

* **Mutual authentication** with automatic identity-based encryption between
  workloads using IPSec or WireGuard.

* **L7-aware policy enforcement** for security and compliance.

* **Deep integration with the Kubernetes Gateway API :** Acts as a
  `Gateway API <https://cilium.io/use-cases/gateway-api/>`_ compliant data
  plane, allowing you to declaratively manage ingress, traffic splitting, and
  routing behavior using Kubernetes-native CRDs.

Observability and Troubleshooting
---------------------------------

Observability is built into Cilium from the ground up, providing rich
visibility that helps operators diagnose and understand system behavior
including:

* **Hubble**: A fully integrated observability platform that offers
  real-time service maps, flow visibility with identity and label metadata,
  and DNS-aware filtering and protocol-specific insights

* **Metrics and alerting**: Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and other
  monitoring systems.

* **Drop reasons and audit trails**: Get actionable insights into why traffic
  was dropped, including policy or port violations and issues like failed
  DNS lookups.
