  # DNS Polling periodically issues a DNS lookup for each `matchName` from
  # cilium-agent. The result is used to regenerate endpoint policy.
  # DNS lookups are repeated with an interval of 5 seconds, and are made for
  # A(IPv4) and AAAA(IPv6) addresses. Should a lookup fail, the most recent IP
  # data is used instead. An IP change will trigger a regeneration of the Cilium
  # policy for each endpoint and increment the per cilium-agent policy
  # repository revision.

  # This option is disabled by default starting from version 1.4.x in favor
