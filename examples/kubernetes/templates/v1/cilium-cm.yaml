  # In Cilium 1.0, all traffic from the host, including from local processes
  # and traffic that is masqueraded from the outside world to the host IP,
  # would be classified as from the host entity (reserved:host label).
  # Furthermore, to allow Kubernetes agents to perform health checks over IP
  # into the endpoints, the host is allowed by default. This means that all
  # traffic from the outside world is also allowed by default, regardless of
  # security policy.
  #
  # This option was introduced in Cilium 1.1 to disable this behaviour. It must
  # be explicitly set to "false" to take effect on Cilium 1.3 or earlier.
  # Cilium 1.4 sets this to "false" by default if it is not specified in the
  # ConfigMap.
  #
  # This option has been deprecated, it will be removed in Cilium 1.5 or later.

  # ct-global-max-entries-* specifies the maximum number of connections
  # supported across all endpoints, split by protocol: tcp or other. One pair
  # of maps uses these values for IPv4 connections, and another pair of maps
  # use these values for IPv6 connections.
  #
  # If these values are modified, then during the next Cilium startup the
  # tracking of ongoing connections may be disrupted. This may lead to brief
  # policy drops or a change in loadbalancing decisions for a connection.
  #
  # For users upgrading from Cilium 1.2 or earlier, to minimize disruption
  # during the upgrade process, comment out these options.

  # Pre-allocation of map entries allows per-packet latency to be reduced, at
  # the expense of up-front memory allocation for the entries in the maps. The
  # default value below will minimize memory usage in the default installation;
  # users who are sensitive to latency may consider setting this to "true".
  #
  # This option was introduced in Cilium 1.4. Cilium 1.3 and earlier ignore
  # this option and behave as though it is set to "true".
  #
  # If this value is modified, then during the next Cilium startup the restore
  # of existing endpoints and tracking of ongoing connections may be disrupted.
  # This may lead to policy drops or a change in loadbalancing decisions for a
  # connection for some time. Endpoints may need to be recreated to restore
  # connectivity.
