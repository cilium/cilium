The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.

For rule types such as `L4Rule` and `CIDR` which can be applied at both ingress and egress, both ingress and egress side have to either specifically allow the connection or one side has to be omitted.

                                      From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.

                                      If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                        APIVersion is the version matched against the api version of the Kafka message. If set, it has to be a string representing a positive integer.

                                        ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.

                                        From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a particular client.

                                        If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

                                        Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request contains multiple topics, then all topics must be allowed or the message will be rejected.

Maximum size of Topic can be 249 characters as per recent Kafka spec and allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, . and _ Older Kafka versions had longer topic lengths of 255, but in Kafka 0.10 version the length was changed from 255 to 249. For compatibility reasons we are using 255
