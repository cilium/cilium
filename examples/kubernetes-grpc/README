This document describes how to build a new version of the
of the containers for the gRPC demo.  None of this is required
to run the demo, as the Kubernetes YAML files point to the
cilium/cc-grpc-demo container image that contains this code already.    

This demo uses the python bindings for gRPC, as documented at
https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/python.html . It is a modified
version of the helloworld app documented on that page.  

Within this kubernetes-grpc directory, clone the grpc repo: 

git clone -b v1.7.x https://github.com/grpc/grpc

Copy cloudcity.proto from this directory to 
grpc/examples/protos .  

Create a new directory grpc/examples/python/cloudcity 

Copy the files cc_door_client.py and cc_door_server.py to 
that directory.  

cd to the grpc/examples/python/cloudcity directory.   Run: 

$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I../../protos --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ../../cloudcity/cloudcity.proto 

The above command will generate the protobuf and grpc stub files in the 
local directory (cloudcity_pb2.py and cloudcity_pb2_grpc.py) 

To build and push the container image, cd back to the kubernetes-grpc directory 
and run: 

docker build -t cilium/cc-grpc-demo . 
docker push cilium/cc-grpc-demo 

Note: the second step above requires you to have permissions to push images
to the Cilium container repo.  If you do not have the permission, you can 
push the image to a repo where you do have access.
