  # Identity allocation mode selects how identities are shared between cilium
  # nodes by setting how they are stored. The options are "crd" or "kvstore".
  # - "crd" stores identities in kubernetes as CRDs (custom resource definition).
  #   These can be queried with:
  #     kubectl get ciliumid
  # - "kvstore" stores identities in a kvstore, etcd or consul, that is
  #   configured below. Cilium versions before 1.6 supported only the kvstore
  #   backend. Upgrades from these older cilium versions should continue using
  #   the kvstore by commenting out the identity-allocation-mode below, or
  #   setting it to "kvstore".
  identity-allocation-mode: crd

  # identity-change-grace-period is the grace period that needs to pass
  # before an endpoint that has changed its identity will start using
  # that new identity. During the grace period, the new identity has
  # already been allocated and other nodes in the cluster have a chance
  # to whitelist the new upcoming identity of the endpoint.
  identity-change-grace-period: "5s"

  # If you want to run cilium in debug mode change this value to true
  debug: "false"

  # Enable IPv4 addressing. If enabled, all endpoints are allocated an IPv4
  # address.

  # Enable IPv6 addressing. If enabled, all endpoints are allocated an IPv6
  # address.
  enable-ipv6: "false"

  # If you want cilium monitor to aggregate tracing for packets, set this level
  # to "low", "medium", or "maximum". The higher the level, the less packets
  # that will be seen in monitor output.
  monitor-aggregation: medium

  # The monitor aggregation interval governs the typical time between monitor
  # notification events for each allowed connection.
  #
  # Only effective when monitor aggregation is set to "medium" or higher.
  monitor-aggregation-interval: 5s

  # bpf-ct-global-*-max specifies the maximum number of connections
  # supported across all endpoints, split by protocol: tcp or other. One pair
  # of maps uses these values for IPv4 connections, and another pair of maps
  # use these values for IPv6 connections.
  #
  # If these values are modified, then during the next Cilium startup the
  # tracking of ongoing connections may be disrupted. This may lead to brief
  # policy drops or a change in loadbalancing decisions for a connection.
  #
  # For users upgrading from Cilium 1.2 or earlier, to minimize disruption
  # during the upgrade process, set bpf-ct-global-tcp-max to 1000000.
  bpf-ct-global-tcp-max: "524288"

  # bpf-nat-global-max specified the maximum number of entries in the BPF NAT
  # table.
  bpf-nat-global-max: "524288"

  # Specifies the ratio (0.0-1.0) of total system memory to use for dynamic
  # sizing of the TCP CT, non-TCP CT, NAT and policy BPF maps.
  bpf-map-dynamic-size-ratio: "0.03"

  # Pre-allocation of map entries allows per-packet latency to be reduced, at
  # the expense of up-front memory allocation for the entries in the maps. The
  # default value below will minimize memory usage in the default installation;
  # users who are sensitive to latency may consider setting this to "true".
  #
  # This option was introduced in Cilium 1.4. Cilium 1.3 and earlier ignore
  # this option and behave as though it is set to "true".
  #
  # If this value is modified, then during the next Cilium startup the restore
  # of existing endpoints and tracking of ongoing connections may be disrupted.
  # This may lead to policy drops or a change in loadbalancing decisions for a
  # connection for some time. Endpoints may need to be recreated to restore
  # connectivity.
  #
  # If this option is set to "false" during an upgrade from 1.3 or earlier to
  # 1.4 or later, then it may cause one-time disruptions during the upgrade.

  # DNS Polling periodically issues a DNS lookup for each `matchName` from
  # cilium-agent. The result is used to regenerate endpoint policy.
  # DNS lookups are repeated with an interval of 5 seconds, and are made for
  # A(IPv4) and AAAA(IPv6) addresses. Should a lookup fail, the most recent IP
  # data is used instead. An IP change will trigger a regeneration of the Cilium
  # policy for each endpoint and increment the per cilium-agent policy
  # repository revision.
  #
  # This option is disabled by default starting from version 1.4.x in favor
  # of a more powerful DNS proxy-based implementation, see [0] for details.
  # Enable this option if you want to use FQDN policies but do not want to use
  # the DNS proxy.
  #
  # To ease upgrade, users may opt to set this option to "true".
  # Otherwise please refer to the Upgrade Guide [1] which explains how to
  # prepare policy rules for upgrade.
