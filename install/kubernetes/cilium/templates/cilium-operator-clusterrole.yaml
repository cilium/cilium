# For cilium-operator running in HA mode.
#
# Cilium operator running in HA mode requires the use of ResourceLock for Leader Election
# between mulitple running instances.
# The preferred way of doing this is to use LeasesResourceLock as edits to Leases are less
# common and fewer objects in the cluster watch "all Leases".
# The support for leases was introduced in coordination.k8s.io/v1 during Kubernetes 1.14 release.
# In Cilium we currently don't support HA mode for K8s version < 1.14. This condition make sure
# that we only authorize access to leases resources in supported K8s versions.
