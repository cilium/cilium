# For cilium-operator running in HA mode.
#
# Cilium operator running in HA mode requires the use of ResourceLock for Leader Election
# between multiple running instances.
# The preferred way of doing this is to use LeasesResourceLock as edits to Leases are less
# common and fewer objects in the cluster watch "all Leases".
