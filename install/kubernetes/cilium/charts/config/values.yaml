# identityChangeGracePeriod is the grace period that needs to pass
# before an endpoint that has changed its identity will start using
# that new identity. During the grace period, the new identity has
# already been allocated and other nodes in the cluster have a chance

# bpfMapDynamicSizeRatio is the ratio (0.0-1.0) of total system memory to use
# for dynamic sizing of CT, NAT, neighbor and SockRevNAT BPF maps. If set to
# 0.0, dynamic sizing of BPF maps is disabled. The default value of 0.0025
# (0.25%) leads to approximately the default CT size kube-proxy sets on a
# node with 16 GiB of total system memory.

# enables non-drop mode for installed policies. In audit mode
