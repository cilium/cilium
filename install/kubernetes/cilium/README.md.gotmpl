Cilium is open source software for providing and transparently securing
network connectivity and loadbalancing between application workloads such as
application containers or processes. Cilium operates at Layer 3/4 to provide
traditional networking and security services as well as Layer 7 to protect and
secure use of modern application protocols such as HTTP, gRPC and Kafka.

A new Linux kernel technology called eBPF is at the foundation of Cilium.
It supports dynamic insertion of eBPF bytecode into the Linux kernel at various
integration points such as: network IO, application sockets, and tracepoints
to implement security, networking and visibility logic. eBPF is highly
efficient and flexible.
