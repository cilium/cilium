# Open Source Licenses

## Overview

The licenses in this directory are taken from [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses).

## Naming Convention

The name of the file is the same as the identifier on the SPDX website with an
extension of `.txt`. For instance, the "Academic Free License v1.1" license
would be in a file called `AFL-1.1.txt`.

### Special variants

Some licenses have special variants. E.g, the Apache-2.0 license has optional
sections in it. And some licenses, like GPL-3.0, have a short "header" variant
that's included in source files. The full text of the license and each of its
special variants will be mapped to the same license. (Though the "header" form
shouldn't be used in `LICENSE` files.)

#### Header Variants

The name of a license header variant is `<identifier>.header.txt`. So the
GPL-3.0 header variant would be named: `GPL-3.0.header.txt`.

#### Optional Text Variants

TBD
