Open Software Licensev. 2.0

This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Open Software License version 2.0

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
Work;

c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that
You distribute shall be licensed under the Open Software License;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-
free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims
owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as
furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original
Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-
readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as
Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the
copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.
Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of
Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to
make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than
the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the
trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work.
Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that
Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use or
distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the
Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You,
whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons
or made available as an application intended for use over a computer network.
As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You agree that
any External Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a
distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as
prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the
terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those
copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately
proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an
"AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including,
without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE
ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an
essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted
hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of
this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
from Licensor&apos;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not
apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work
or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the
circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this
License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between
Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon
the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1
herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or
another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to
You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all
of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you
may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon
Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this
License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a
patent applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a
patent applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the
Original Work with other software or hardware).

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty.
This section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys&apos; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action,
including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the
termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License,
whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,
"control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
