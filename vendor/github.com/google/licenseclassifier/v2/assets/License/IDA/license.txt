IDA License Agreement

The IDA computer programs, hereafter described as "the software"
are licensed, not sold, to you by Hex-Rays SA pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. Hex-Rays SA reserves any
right not expressly granted to you. You own the media on which the
software is delivered but Hex-Rays SA retains ownership of all
copies of the software itself. The software is protected by copyright
law.

The following licenses schemes exist:

  - per named user license
  - per fixed computer license
  - floating (roaming) license

Each per user license permits the user to install the software on his/her
office workstation, personal laptop and home computer, provided that
no other user uses the software on those computers. Each per user license
permits the user to use the software on only one physical computer at a time.

Each per fixed computer license permits your company to install and use the
software on only one physical or virtual computer.

Each floating license permits your company to install the software on
as many computers as required. One floating license permits
one concurrent use of the software.

This license also allows you to

 - make as many copies of the installation media as you need for backup
   or installation purposes.
 - reverse-engineer the software.
 - with our written agreement, transfer the software and all rights under this
   license to an other party together with a copy of this license and all
   material, written or electronic, accompanying the software, provided that
   the other party reads and accepts the terms and conditions of this license.
   You lose the right to use the software and all other rights under this
   license when transferring the software.

The license is a temporary license subject to full payment of all invoices
issued by Hex-Rays SA for the software. Upon full payment the license
becomes a permanent license. In the event that any payment for the software
is not received in a timely manner, you must immediately discontinue its use.

electronically transfer the software from one computer to another if
