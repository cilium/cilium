Hi Kevin,
Thanks for asking. Those routines are public domain (originally posted to
comp.sys.arm a long time ago), so you can use them freely for any purpose.
Cheers,
Wilco

Hi Wilco,
I saw your sqrt routine from several web sites, including
http://www.finesse.demon.co.uk/steven/sqrt.html.
Just wonder if there's any copyright information with your Successive
approximation routines, or if I can freely use it for any purpose.
Thanks.
Kevin
