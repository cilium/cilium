v. Speech namespace API. Using speech recognition functionality via the Speech
namespace APIs in a program requires the support of a speech recognition
service. The service may require network connectivity at the time of
recognition (e.g., when using a predefined grammar). In addition, the service
may also collect speech-related data in order to provide and improve the
service. The speech-related data may include, for example, information related
to grammar size and string phrases in a grammar.
vi. 	Also, in order for a user to use speech recognition on the phone they
must first accept certain terms of use. The terms of use notify the user that
data related to their use of the speech recognition service will be collected
and used to provide and improve the service. If a user does not accept the
terms of use and speech recognition is attempted by the application, the
operation will not work and an error will be returned to the application.
vii. API Use. We may monitor and collect data related to a program’s use of
APIs in order to provide, improve and personalize Microsoft products and
services.  End user information collected by Microsoft‘s monitoring and data
collection related to your program’s use of APIs is subject to the Microsoft
Consumer Privacy Statement.

addition to the other limitations in this agreement, you must comply with all
applicable local laws and regulations when using the device ID access component
or the rest of the software.
x. PlayReady Support. The software may include the Windows Emulator, which
contains Microsoft’s PlayReady content access technology.  Content owners use
Microsoft PlayReady content access technology to protect their intellectual
property, including copyrighted content.  This software uses PlayReady
technology to access PlayReady-protected content and/or WMDRM-protected
content.  Microsoft may decide to revoke the software’s ability to consume
PlayReady-protected content for reasons including but not limited to (i) if a
breach or potential breach of PlayReady technology occurs, (ii) proactive
robustness enhancement, and (iii) if Content owners require the revocation
because the software fails to properly enforce restrictions on content usage.
Revocation should not affect unprotected content or content protected by other
content access technologies.  Content owners may require you to upgrade
PlayReady to access their content.  If you decline an upgrade, you will not be
able to access content that requires the upgrade and may not be able to install
other operating system updates or upgrades.
xi. Package Managers. The software may include package managers, like NuGet,
that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software
packages to use with your application. Those packages are under their own
licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or
provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
xii. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to
display and print content. You may only embed fonts in content as permitted by
the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and temporarily download them to a
printer or other output device to help print content.
xiii. Notice about the H.264/AVD Visual Standard, and the VC-1 Video Standard.
This software may include H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VD-1 decoding technology.

PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER
LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NONE OF THE LICENSES EXTEND TO ANY OTHER
PRODUCT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PRODUCT IS INCLUDED WITH THIS SOFTWARE IN A
SINGLE ARTICLE. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE WWW.MPEGLA.COM.
d. For clarification purposes, this notice does not limit or inhibit the use of
the software for normal business uses that are personal to that business which
do not include (i) redistribution of the software to third parties, or (ii)
creation of content with the VIDEO STANDARDS compliant technologies for
distribution to third parties.
e. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the
software. It may change or cancel them at any time.
f. Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below
and in the privacy statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839
connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In
some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some
cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. By using these
features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does
not use the information to identify or contact you.
i. Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which
send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet
protocol address, the type of operating system, browser, and name and version
of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you
installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the
Internet-based services available to you.
Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). This software uses CEIP. CEIP
automatically sends Microsoft information about your hardware and how you use
the software. We do not use this information to identify or contact you. CEIP
will also periodically download a small file to your computer. This file helps
us collect information about problems that you have while using the software.
When available, new help information about the errors might also be
automatically downloaded. To learn more about CEIP and how to turn it off, see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525878.
Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital
certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard
encryption information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and
macros to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software
retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists using the
Internet, when available.
Error Reports. This software automatically sends error reports to Microsoft.
These reports include information about problems that occur in the software.
Sometimes reports contain information about other programs that interact with
the software. Reports might unintentionally contain personal information. For
example, a report that contains a snapshot of computer memory might include
your name. Part of a document you were working on could be included as well.
Microsoft does not use this information to identify or contact you. To learn
more about error reports, see http://oca.microsoft.com/en/dcp20.asp.
Windows Application Certification Kit. To ensure you have the latest
certification tests, when launched this software periodically checks a Windows
Application Certification Kit file on download.microsft.com to see if an update
is available.  If an update is found, you are prompted and provided a link to
a web site where you can download the update. You may use the Windows
Application Certification Kit solely to test your programs before you submit
them for a potential Microsoft Windows Certification and for inclusion on the
Microsoft Windows Store. The results you receive are for informational purposes
only. Microsoft has no obligation to either (i) provide you with a Windows
Certification for your programs and/or ii) include your program in the
Microsoft Windows Store.
Microsoft Digital Rights Management for Silverlight.
If you use Silverlight to access content that has been protected with Microsoft
Digital Rights Management (DRM), in order to let you play the content, the
software may automatically
request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet and
download and install available DRM Updates.
For more information about this feature, including instructions for turning the
Automatic Updates off, go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=147032.
1. Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content
from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content, these features
send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the
software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where
you installed the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates,
online training, online assistance, help and Appshelp. You may choose not to
use these web content features.
ii. Use of Information. We may use the computer information, error reports, and
CEIP information, to improve our software and services. We may also share it
with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the
information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
iii. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any
way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use
