Pre-release versions of the Apple Software or Apple Services should not be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a final-release, commercial-grade product, nor should they be used with data that is not sufficiently and regularly backed up.    The pre-release Apple Software and Apple Services may contain inaccuracies or errors that could cause failures or loss of data and may be incomplete.    You should back up Your data prior to using any pre-release Apple Software and Apple Services and not rely on them to perform in the same way as a commercial release of the Apple Software and Services.

3.2	Confidentiality
You agree that pre-release versions of the Apple Software and Apple Services (including pre-release Documentation) will be deemed “Apple Confidential Information”; provided however that upon the commercial release of the Apple Software and Apple Services, such pre-release versions of the Apple Software and Apple Services will no longer be confidential.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple, (iii) information that is independently developed by You without the use of any Apple Confidential Information, (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation, or (v) any FOSS included in the Apple Software and Apple Services and accompanied by licensing terms that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such FOSS.    Further, Apple agrees that You will not be bound by the foregoing confidentiality terms with regard to technical information about pre-release Apple Software or Apple Services disclosed by Apple at WWDC (Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference), except that You may not post screen shots of, write public reviews of, or redistribute any pre-release Apple Software or Services.

You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.    You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without Apple's prior written consent.    You further agree not to disclose or disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) Authorized Developers; or (ii) as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by Apple.    You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential Information.    You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.

4.	Indemnification
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an “Apple Indemnified Party”) from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively “Losses”) incurred by an Apple Indemnified Party as a result of Your breach of this Agreement, a breach of any certification, covenant, representation or warranty made by You in this Agreement, any claims that Your Applications violate or infringe any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from Your use of the Apple Software and Apple Services, Your Applications, Your development of Applications, or Your loading of Applications and limited distribution as permitted hereunder.    You acknowledge that the Apple Software and Apple Services is not intended for use in the development of Applications in which errors or inaccuracies in the content, functionality, services, data or information provided by the Application or the failure of the Application could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, and, to the extent permitted by law, You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Apple Indemnified Party from any Losses incurred by such Apple Indemnified Party by reason of any such use.    In no event may You enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects Apple's rights or binds Apple in any way, without the prior written consent of Apple.

5.	Term and Termination
The license to use this version of the Apple Software and Apple Services is effective until terminated as set forth herein.

This Agreement and all rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple if You or any of Your Authorized Developers fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement.    All rights hereunder in any beta or pre-release versions of the Apple Software for a particular release will terminate upon the commercial release of such Apple Software.

Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, You agree to immediately cease all use of the Apple Software and Apple Services and erase and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Apple Software and Apple Services and all copies of Apple Confidential Information in Your and Your Authorized Developers' possession or control.    At Apple’s request, You agree to provide written certification of such destruction to Apple.

Apple reserves the right to revoke, disable or suspend any Provisioning Profiles or any access to the device deployment and provisioning features of the Apple Software and Services at any time, in its sole discretion.    By way of example, Apple may do this if Apple has reason to believe that Apple IDs were fraudulently obtained, that an unreasonable number of devices have been entered into the Apple Software, and/or that the Services are being used in a fraudulent, suspicious, or improper manner.

The following terms shall survive termination: Section 1, the last sentence of Section 2.1, the last two sentences of Section 2.2B., the second to last sentence of Section 2.4, Section 2.6, Section 2.7, Section 2.12B, 2.12D, the last sentence of 2.13, and Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.    Apple will not be liable for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy Apple may have, now or in the future.
