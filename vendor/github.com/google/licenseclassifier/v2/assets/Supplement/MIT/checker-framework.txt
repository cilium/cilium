Checker Framework Annotations
*******************************************************************************
A few parts of the Checker Framework have more permissive licenses.

 * The annotations are licensed under the MIT License.  (The text of this
   license appears below.)  More specifically, all the parts of the Checker
   Framework that you might want to include with your own program use the
   MIT License.  This is the checker-qual.jar file and all the files that
   appear in it:  every file in a qual/ directory, plus NullnessUtils.java
   and RegexUtil.java.  In addition, the cleanroom implementations of
   third-party annotations, which the Checker Framework recognizes as
   aliases for its own annotations, are licensed under the MIT License.
