# Next Steps

That concludes the getting started guide for Serf. Hopefully you're able to
see that while Serf is an incredibly simple tool, it is also extremely
powerful. The dead simple membership information and events system that
Serf provides make up the building blocks of [incredible use cases](/intro/use-cases.html).

And because Serf is completely decentralized, fault tolerant, self-healing,
etc. it is a dream tool for system administrators and built specifically
for modern, elastic infrastructures.

As a next step, the following resources are available:

* [Documentation](/docs/index.html) - The documentation is an in-depth reference
  guide to all the features of Serf, including technical details about the
  internals of how Serf operates.

* [Examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/serf/tree/master/demo) - The work-in-progress examples folder within the GitHub
  repository for Serf contains functional examples of various use cases
  of Serf to help you get started with exactly what you need.
