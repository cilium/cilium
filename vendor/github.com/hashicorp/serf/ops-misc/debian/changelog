serf (0.6.0-0) unstable; urgency=low
  FEATURES:

   * Support for key rotation when using encryption. This adds a new
   `serf keys` command, and a `-keyring-file` configuration. Thanks
   to @ryanuber.

   * New `-tags-file` can be specified to persist changes to tags made
   via the RPC interface. Thanks to @ryanuber.

   * New `serf info` command to provide operator debugging information,
   and to get info about the local node.

   * Adding `-retry-join` flag to agent which enables retrying the join
   until success or `-retry-max` attempts have been made.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * New `-rejoin` flag can be used along with a snapshot file to
   automatically rejoin a cluster.

   * Agent uses circular buffer to invoke handlers, guards against unbounded
   output lengths.

   * Adding support for logging to syslog

   * The SERF_RPC_ADDR environment variable can be used instead of the
   `-rpc-addr` flags. Thanks to @lalyos [GH-209].

   * `serf query` can now output the results in a JSON format.

   * Unknown configuration directives generate an error [GH-186].
   Thanks to @vincentbernat.

  BUG FIXES:

   * Fixing environmental variables with invalid characters. [GH-200].
   Thanks to @arschles.

   * Fixing issue with tag changes with hard restart before
     failure detection.

   * Fixing issue with reconnect when using dynamic ports.

  MISC:

   * Improved logging of various error messages

   * Improved debian packaging. Thanks to @vincentbernat.
