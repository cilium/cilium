# Development Report for June 5, 2017

## Daily Meeting

A daily meeting is hosted on [slack](https://dockercommunity.slack.com) every business day at 9am PST on the channel `#moby-project`.
Lots of discussion happened during this meeting to kickstart the project, but now that we have the forums, we see less activity there.
We are discussing the future of this meeting [here](https://forums.mobyproject.org/t/of-standups-future), we will possibily move the meeting
to weekly.

## Topics discussed last week

### The CLI split

Thanks to @tiborvass, the man pages, docs and completion scripts were imported to `github.com/docker/cli` [last week](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/147)
Once everything is finalised, we will remove them from `github.com/moby/moby`

### Find a good and non-confusing home for the remaining monolith

Discussion on this topic is still ongoing, and possible approaches are looked into. The active discussion has moved
from GitHub to [https://forums.mobyproject.org/](https://forums.mobyproject.org/t/topic-find-a-good-an-non-confusing-home-for-the-remaining-monolith)


### Find a place for `/pkg`
