## CloudFlare's PKI/TLS toolkit

CFSSL is CloudFlare's PKI/TLS swiss army knife. It is both a command line
tool and an HTTP API server for signing, verifying, and bundling TLS
certificates. It requires Go 1.5+ to build.

Note that certain linux distributions have certain algorithms removed
(RHEL-based distributions in particular), so the golang from the
official repositories will not work. Users of these distributions should
[install go manually](//golang.org/dl) to install CFSSL.

CFSSL consists of:

* a set of packages useful for building custom TLS PKI tools
* the `cfssl` program, which is the canonical command line utility
  using the CFSSL packages.
* the `multirootca` program, which is a certificate authority server
  that can use multiple signing keys.
* the `mkbundle` program is used to build certificate pool bundles.
* the `cfssljson` program, which takes the JSON output from the
  `cfssl` and `multirootca` programs and writes certificates, keys,
  CSRs, and bundles to disk.

### Building

See [BUILDING](BUILDING.md)

### Installation

Installation requires a
[working Go 1.5+ installation](http://golang.org/doc/install) and a
properly set `GOPATH`.

```
$ go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssl
```

will download and build the CFSSL tool, installing it in
`$GOPATH/bin/cfssl`. To install the other utility programs that are in
this repo:

```
$ go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/...
```

This will download, build, and install `cfssl`, `cfssljson`, and
`mkbundle` into `$GOPATH/bin/`.

Note that CFSSL makes use of vendored packages; in Go 1.5, the
`GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` environment variable will need to be set, e.g.

```
export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1
```

In Go 1.6, this works out of the box.

#### Installing pre-Go 1.5
With a Go 1.4 or earlier installation, you won't be able to install the latest version of CFSSL. However, you can checkout the `1.1.0` release and build that.

```
git clone -b 1.1.0 https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudflare/cfssl
go get github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssl
```

### Using the Command Line Tool

The `cfssl` command line tool takes a command to specify what
operation it should carry out:

       sign             signs a certificate
       bundle           build a certificate bundle
       genkey           generate a private key and a certificate request
       gencert          generate a private key and a certificate
       serve            start the API server
       version          prints out the current version
       selfsign         generates a self-signed certificate
       print-defaults	print default configurations

Use "cfssl [command] -help" to find out more about a command.
The version command takes no arguments.

#### Signing

```
cfssl sign [-ca cert] [-ca-key key] [-hostname comma,separated,hostnames] csr [subject]
```

The csr is the client's certificate request. The `-ca` and `-ca-key`
flags are the CA's certificate and private key, respectively. By
default, they are "ca.pem" and "ca_key.pem". The `-hostname` is
a comma separated hostname list that overrides the DNS names and
IP address in the certificate SAN extension.
For example, assuming the CA's private key is in
`/etc/ssl/private/cfssl_key.pem` and the CA's certificate is in
`/etc/ssl/certs/cfssl.pem`, to sign the `cloudflare.pem` certificate
for cloudflare.com:

```
cfssl sign -ca /etc/ssl/certs/cfssl.pem \
           -ca-key /etc/ssl/private/cfssl_key.pem \
           -hostname cloudflare.com ./cloudflare.pem
```

It is also possible to specify csr through '-csr' flag. By doing so,
flag values take precedence and will overwrite the argument.

The subject is an optional file that contains subject information that
should be used in place of the information from the CSR. It should be
a JSON file with the type:

```json
{
    "CN": "example.com",
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "US",
            "L": "San Francisco",
            "O": "Internet Widgets, Inc.",
            "OU": "WWW",
            "ST": "California"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Bundling

```
cfssl bundle [-ca-bundle bundle] [-int-bundle bundle] \
             [-metadata metadata_file] [-flavor bundle_flavor] \
             -cert certificate_file [-key key_file]
```

The bundles are used for the root and intermediate certificate
pools. In addition, platform metadata is specified through '-metadata'
The bundle files, metadata file (and auxiliary files) can be
found at [cfssl_trust](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl_trust)


Specify PEM-encoded client certificate and key through '-cert' and
'-key' respectively. If key is specified, the bundle will be built
and verified with the key. Otherwise the bundle will be built
without a private key. Instead of file path, use '-' for reading
certificate PEM from stdin. It is also acceptable the certificate
file contains a (partial) certificate bundle.

Specify bundling flavor through '-flavor'. There are three flavors:
'optimal' to generate a bundle of shortest chain and most advanced
cryptographic algorithms, 'ubiquitous' to generate a bundle of most
widely acceptance across different browsers and OS platforms, and
'force' to find an acceptable bundle which is identical to the
content of the input certificate file.

Alternatively, the client certificate can be pulled directly from
a domain. It is also possible to connect to the remote address
through '-ip'.

```
cfssl bundle [-ca-bundle bundle] [-int-bundle bundle] \
             [-metadata metadata_file] [-flavor bundle_flavor] \
             -domain domain_name [-ip ip_address]
```

The bundle output form should follow the example

```json
{
    "bundle": "CERT_BUNDLE_IN_PEM",
    "crt": "LEAF_CERT_IN_PEM",
    "crl_support": true,
    "expires": "2015-12-31T23:59:59Z",
    "hostnames": ["example.com"],
    "issuer": "ISSUER CERT SUBJECT",
    "key": "KEY_IN_PEM",
    "key_size": 2048,
    "key_type": "2048-bit RSA",
    "ocsp": ["http://ocsp.example-ca.com"],
    "ocsp_support": true,
    "root": "ROOT_CA_CERT_IN_PEM",
    "signature": "SHA1WithRSA",
    "subject": "LEAF CERT SUBJECT",
    "status": {
        "rebundled": false,
        "expiring_SKIs": [],
        "untrusted_root_stores": [],
        "messages": [],
        "code": 0
    }
}
```


#### Generating certificate signing request and private key

```
cfssl genkey csr.json
```

To generate a private key and corresponding certificate request, specify
the key request as a JSON file. This file should follow the form

```json
{
    "hosts": [
        "example.com",
        "www.example.com"
    ],
    "key": {
        "algo": "rsa",
        "size": 2048
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "US",
            "L": "San Francisco",
            "O": "Internet Widgets, Inc.",
            "OU": "WWW",
            "ST": "California"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Generating self-signed root CA certificate and private key

```
cfssl genkey -initca csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
```

To generate a self-signed root CA certificate, specify the key request as
the JSON file in the same format as in 'genkey'. Three PEM-encoded entities
will appear in the output: the private key, the csr, and the self-signed
certificate.

#### Generating a remote-issued certificate and private key.

```
cfssl gencert -remote=remote_server [-hostname=comma,separated,hostnames] csr.json
```

This is calls genkey, but has a remote CFSSL server sign and issue
a certificate. You may use `-hostname` to override certificate SANs.

#### Generating a local-issued certificate and private key.

```
cfssl gencert -ca cert -ca-key key [-hostname=comma,separated,hostnames] csr.json
```

This is generates and issues a certificate and private key from a local CA
via a JSON request. You may use `-hostname` to override certificate SANs.


#### Updating a OCSP responses file with a newly issued certificate

```
cfssl ocspsign -ca cert -responder key -responder-key key -cert cert \
 | cfssljson -bare -stdout >> responses
```

This will generate a OCSP response for the `cert` and add it to the
`responses` file. You can then pass `responses` to `ocspserve` to start a
OCSP server.

### Starting the API Server

CFSSL comes with an HTTP-based API server; the endpoints are
documented in `doc/api.txt`. The server is started with the "serve"
command:

```
cfssl serve [-address address] [-ca cert] [-ca-bundle bundle] \
            [-ca-key key] [-int-bundle bundle] [-int-dir dir] [-port port] \
            [-metadata file] [-remote remote_host] [-config config] \
            [-responder cert] [-responder-key key] [-db-config db-config]
```

Address and port default to "127.0.0.1:8888". The `-ca` and `-ca-key`
arguments should be the PEM-encoded certificate and private key to use
for signing; by default, they are "ca.pem" and "ca_key.pem". The
`-ca-bundle` and `-int-bundle` should be the certificate bundles used
for the root and intermediate certificate pools, respectively. These
default to "ca-bundle.crt" and "int-bundle." If the "remote" option is
provided, all signature operations will be forwarded to the remote CFSSL.

'-int-dir' specifies intermediates directory. '-metadata' is a file for
root certificate presence. The content of the file is a json dictionary 
(k,v): each key k is SHA-1 digest of a root certificate while value v 
is a list of key store filenames. '-config' specifies path to configuration
file. '-responder' and  '-responder-key' are Certificate for OCSP responder
and private key for OCSP responder certificate, respectively.

The amount of logging can be controlled with the `-loglevel` option. This
comes *after* the serve command:

```
cfssl serve -loglevel 2
```

The levels are:

* 0. DEBUG
* 1. INFO (this is the default level)
* 2. WARNING
* 3. ERROR
* 4. CRITICAL

### The multirootca

The `cfssl` program can act as an online certificate authority, but it
only uses a single key. If multiple signing keys are needed, the
`multirootca` program can be used. It only provides the sign,
authsign, and info endpoints. The documentation contains instructions
for configuring and running the CA.

### The mkbundle Utility

`mkbundle` is used to build the root and intermediate bundles used in
verifying certificates. It can be installed with

```
go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/mkbundle
```

It takes a collection of certificates, checks for CRL revocation (OCSP
support is planned for the next release) and expired certificates, and
bundles them into one file. It takes directories of certificates and
certificate files (which may contain multiple certificates). For example,
if the directory `intermediates` contains a number of intermediate
certificates,

```
mkbundle -f int-bundle.crt intermediates
```

will check those certificates and combine valid ones into a single
`int-bundle.crt` file.

The `-f` flag specifies an output name; `-loglevel` specifies the verbosity
of the logging (using the same loglevels above), and `-nw` controls the
number of revocation-checking workers.

### The cfssljson Utility

Most of the output from `cfssl` is in JSON. The `cfssljson` will take
this output and split it out into separate key, certificate, CSR, and
bundle files as appropriate. The tool takes a single flag, `-f`, that
specifies the input file, and an argument that specifies the base name for
the files produced. If the input filename is "-" (which is the default),
`cfssljson` reads from standard input. It maps keys in the JSON file to
filenames in the following way:

* if there is a "cert" (or if not, if there's a "certificate") field, the
  file "basename.pem" will be produced.
* if there is a "key" (or if not, if there's a "private_key") field, the
  file "basename-key.pem" will be produced.
* if there is a "csr" (or if not, if there's a "certificate_request") field,
  the file "basename.csr" will be produced.
* if there is a "bundle" field, the file "basename-bundle.pem" will
  be produced.
* if there is a "ocspResponse" field, the file "basename-response.der" will
  be produced.

Instead of saving to a file, you can pass `-stdout` to output the encoded
contents.

### Static Builds

By default, the web assets are accessed from disk, based on their
relative locations.  If you’re wishing to distribute a single,
statically-linked, cfssl binary, you’ll want to embed these resources
before building.  This can by done with the
[go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) tool.

```
pushd cli/serve && rice embed-go && popd
```

Then building with `go build` will use the embedded resources.

### Using a PKCS#11 hardware token / HSM

For better security, you may want to store your private key in an HSM or
smartcard. The interface to both of these categories of device is described by
the PKCS#11 spec. If you need to do approximately one signing operation per
second or fewer, the Yubikey NEO and NEO-n are inexpensive smartcard options:
https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/. In general you
are looking for a product that supports PIV (personal identity verification). If
your signing needs are in the hundreds of signatures per second, you will need
to purchase an expensive HSM (in the thousands to many thousands of USD).

If you want to try out the PKCS#11 signing modes without a hardware token, you
can use the [SoftHSM](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv1#softhsm)
implementation. Please note that using SoftHSM simply stores your private key in
a file on disk and does not increase security.

To get started with your PKCS#11 token you will need to initialize it with a
private key, PIN, and token label. The instructions to do this will be specific
to each hardware device, and you should follow the instructions provided by your
vendor. You will also need to find the path to your 'module', a shared object
file (.so). Having initialized your device, you can query it to check your token
label with:

    pkcs11-tool --module <module path> --list-token-slots

You'll also want to check the label of the private key you imported (or
generated). Run the following command and look for a 'Private Key Object':

    pkcs11-tool --module <module path> --pin <pin> \
      --list-token-slots --login --list-objects

You now have all the information you need to use your PKCS#11 token with CFSSL.
CFSSL supports PKCS#11 for certificate signing and OCSP signing. To create a
Signer (for certificate signing), import `signer/universal` and call NewSigner
with a Root object containing the module, pin, token label and private label
from above, plus a path to your certificate. The structure of the Root object is
documented in universal.go.

Alternately, you can construct a pkcs11key.Key or pkcs11key.Pool yourself, and
pass it to ocsp.NewSigner (for OCSP) or local.NewSigner (for certificate
signing). This will be necessary, for example, if you are using a single-session
token like the Yubikey and need both OCSP signing and certificate signing at the
same time.
