	// change the SessionID, at which time an agent must re-register and obtain
	// a new one.
	//
	// All Dispatcher calls after register should include the SessionID. If the
	// Dispatcher so chooses, it may reject the call with an InvalidArgument
	// error code, at which time the agent should call Register to start a new
	// session.
	//
	// As a rule, once an agent has a SessionID, it should never save it to
	// disk or try to otherwise reuse. If the agent loses its SessionID, it
	// must start a new session through a call to Register. A Dispatcher may
	// choose to reuse the SessionID, if it sees fit, but it is not advised.
	//
	// The actual implementation of the SessionID is Dispatcher specific and
	// should be treated as opaque by agents.
	//
	// From a Dispatcher perspective, there are many ways to use the SessionID
	// to ensure uniqueness of a set of client RPC calls. One method is to keep
	// the SessionID unique to every call to Register in a single Dispatcher
	// instance. This ensures that the SessionID represents the unique
	// session from a single Agent to Manager. If the Agent restarts, we
	// allocate a new session, since the restarted Agent is not aware of the
	// new SessionID.
	//
	// The most compelling use case is to support duplicate node detection. If
	// one clones a virtual machine, including certificate material, two nodes
	// may end up with the same identity. This can also happen if two identical
	// agent processes are coming from the same node. If the SessionID is
	// replicated through the cluster, we can immediately detect the condition
	// and address it.
	//
	// Extending from the case above, we can actually detect a compromised
	// identity. Coupled with provisions to rebuild node identity, we can ban
	// the compromised node identity and have the nodes re-authenticate and
	// build a new identity. At this time, an administrator can then
	// re-authorize the compromised nodes, if it was a mistake or ensure that a
	// misbehaved node can no longer connect to the cluster.
