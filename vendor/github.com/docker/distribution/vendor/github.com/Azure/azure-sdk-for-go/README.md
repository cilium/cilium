This is Microsoft Azure's core repository for hosting Go packages which offer a more convenient way of targeting Azure
REST endpoints. Here, you'll find a mix of code generated by [Autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) and hand
maintained packages.

> **NOTE:** This repository is under heavy ongoing development and should be considered a preview. Vendoring your
dependencies is always a good idea, but it is doubly important if you're consuming this library.

# Installation
- If you don't already have it, install [the Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Go get the SDK:

```
$ go get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go
```

> **IMPORTANT:** We highly suggest vendoring Azure SDK for Go as a dependency. For vendoring dependencies, Azure SDK
for Go uses [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide).

# Versioning
## SDK Versions
The tags in this repository are based on, but do not conform to [SemVer.org's recommendations](http://semver.org/).
For now, the "-beta" tag is an indicator that we are still in preview and still are planning on releasing some breaking
changes.

In repositories that are children of this one, [storage for example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-go), we
have adopted SemVer.org's recommendations.

## Azure Versions
Azure services _mostly_ do not use SemVer based versions. Rather, they use profiles identified by dates. One will often
see this casually referred to as an "APIVersion". At the moment, our SDK only supports the most recent profiles. In
order to lock to an API version, one must also lock to an SDK version. However, as discussed in 
[#517](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/517), our objective is to reorganize and publish independent
packages for each profile. In that way, we'll be able to have parallel support in a single SDK version for all
APIVersions supported by Azure.
