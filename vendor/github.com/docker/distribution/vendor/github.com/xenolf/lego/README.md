#### General
This is a work in progress. Please do *NOT* run this on a production server and please report any bugs you find!

#### Installation
lego supports both binary installs and install from source.

To get the binary just download the latest release for your OS/Arch from [the release page](https://github.com/xenolf/lego/releases)
and put the binary somewhere convenient. lego does not assume anything about the location you run it from.

To install from source, just run 
```
go get -u github.com/xenolf/lego
```

To build lego inside a Docker container, just run
```
docker build -t lego .
```

#### Features

- Register with CA
- Obtain certificates
- Renew certificates
- Revoke certificates
- Robust implementation of all ACME challenges
  - HTTP (http-01)
  - TLS with Server Name Indication (tls-sni-01)
  - DNS (dns-01)
- SAN certificate support
- Comes with multiple optional [DNS providers](https://github.com/xenolf/lego/tree/master/providers/dns)
- [Custom challenge solvers](https://github.com/xenolf/lego/wiki/Writing-a-Challenge-Solver)
- Certificate bundling
- OCSP helper function

Please keep in mind that CLI switches and APIs are still subject to change.

When using the standard `--path` option, all certificates and account configurations are saved to a folder *.lego* in the current working directory.

#### Sudo
The CLI does not require root permissions but needs to bind to port 80 and 443 for certain challenges. 
To run the CLI without sudo, you have four options:

- Use setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/program
- Pass the `--http` or/and the `--tls` option and specify a custom port to bind to. In this case you have to forward port 80/443 to these custom ports (see [Port Usage](#port-usage)).
- Pass the `--webroot` option and specify the path to your webroot folder. In this case the challenge will be written in a file in `.well-known/acme-challenge/` inside your webroot.
- Pass the `--dns` option and specify a DNS provider.

#### Port Usage
By default lego assumes it is able to bind to ports 80 and 443 to solve challenges.
If this is not possible in your environment, you can use the `--http` and `--tls` options to instruct
lego to listen on that interface:port for any incoming challenges.

If you are using this option, make sure you proxy all of the following traffic to these ports.

HTTP Port:
- All plaintext HTTP requests to port 80 which begin with a request path of `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` for the HTTP challenge.

TLS Port:
- All TLS handshakes on port 443 for the TLS-SNI challenge.

This traffic redirection is only needed as long as lego solves challenges. As soon as you have received your certificates you can deactivate the forwarding.

##### CLI Example

Assumes the `lego` binary has permission to bind to ports 80 and 443. You can get a pre-built binary from the [releases](https://github.com/xenolf/lego/releases) page.
If your environment does not allow you to bind to these ports, please read [Port Usage](#port-usage).

Obtain a certificate:

```bash
$ lego --email="foo@bar.com" --domains="example.com" run
```

(Find your certificate in the `.lego` folder of current working directory.)

To renew the certificate:

```bash
$ lego --email="foo@bar.com" --domains="example.com" renew
```

Obtain a certificate using the DNS challenge and AWS Route 53:

```bash
$ AWS_REGION=us-east-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my_id AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my_key lego --email="foo@bar.com" --domains="example.com" --dns="route53" run
```

Note that `--dns=foo` implies `--exclude=http-01` and `--exclude=tls-sni-01`. lego will not attempt other challenges if you've told it to use DNS instead.

lego defaults to communicating with the production Let's Encrypt ACME server. If you'd like to test something without issuing real certificates, consider using the staging endpoint instead:

```bash
$ lego --server=https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory â€¦
```

#### DNS Challenge API Details

##### AWS Route 53

The following AWS IAM policy document describes the permissions required for lego to complete the DNS challenge.
Replace `<INSERT_YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID_HERE>` with the Route 53 zone ID of the domain you are authorizing.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:GetChange",
                "route53:ListHostedZonesByName"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/<INSERT_YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID_HERE>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### ACME Library Usage

A valid, but bare-bones example use of the acme package:

```go
// You'll need a user or account type that implements acme.User
type MyUser struct {
	Email        string
	Registration *acme.RegistrationResource
	key          crypto.PrivateKey
}
func (u MyUser) GetEmail() string {
	return u.Email
}
func (u MyUser) GetRegistration() *acme.RegistrationResource {
	return u.Registration
}
func (u MyUser) GetPrivateKey() crypto.PrivateKey {
	return u.key
}

// Create a user. New accounts need an email and private key to start.
const rsaKeySize = 2048
privateKey, err := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, rsaKeySize)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
myUser := MyUser{
	Email: "you@yours.com",
	key: privateKey,
}

// A client facilitates communication with the CA server. This CA URL is
// configured for a local dev instance of Boulder running in Docker in a VM.
client, err := acme.NewClient("http://192.168.99.100:4000", &myUser, acme.RSA2048)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

// We specify an http port of 5002 and an tls port of 5001 on all interfaces
// because we aren't running as root and can't bind a listener to port 80 and 443 
// (used later when we attempt to pass challenges). Keep in mind that we still
// need to proxy challenge traffic to port 5002 and 5001.
client.SetHTTPAddress(":5002")
client.SetTLSAddress(":5001")

// New users will need to register
reg, err := client.Register()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
myUser.Registration = reg

// SAVE THE USER.

// The client has a URL to the current Let's Encrypt Subscriber
// Agreement. The user will need to agree to it.
err = client.AgreeToTOS()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// The acme library takes care of completing the challenges to obtain the certificate(s).
// The domains must resolve to this machine or you have to use the DNS challenge.
bundle := false
certificates, failures := client.ObtainCertificate([]string{"mydomain.com"}, bundle, nil)
if len(failures) > 0 {
	log.Fatal(failures)
}

// Each certificate comes back with the cert bytes, the bytes of the client's
// private key, and a certificate URL. SAVE THESE TO DISK.
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", certificates)

// ... all done.
```
