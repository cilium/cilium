# Contributions are very welcome!

## First: Create an Issue

Even if your fix is simple, we'd like to have an issue to relate to
the PR.  Discussion about the architecture and value can go on the
issue, leaving PR comments exclusively for coding style.

## Second: Make Your PR

- Fork the `master` branch
- Make your change
- Make a PR against the `master` branch

You don't need to wait for comments on the issue before making your
PR.  If you do wait for comments, you'll have a better chance of
getting your PR accepted the first time around, but it's not
necessary.

## Third: Be Patient

- If your change breaks backward compatibility, this becomes
  especially true.

We all have lives and jobs, and many of us are no longer on projects
that make use of `gorp`.  We will get back to you, but it might take a
while.

## Fourth: Consider Becoming a Maintainer

We really do need help.  We will likely ask you for help after a good
PR, but if we don't, please create an issue requesting maintainership.
Considering how few of us are currently active, we are unlikely to
refuse good help.
