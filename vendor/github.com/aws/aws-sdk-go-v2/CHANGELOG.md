# Release 2021-05-06

## Breaking change
* `service/ec2` - v1.6.0
  * This release contains a breaking change to the Amazon EC2 API client. API number(int/int64/etc) and boolean members were changed from value, to pointer type. Your applications using the EC2 API client will fail to compile after upgrading for all members that were updated. To migrate to this module you'll need to update your application to use pointers for all number and boolean members in the API client module. The SDK provides helper utilities to convert between value and pointer types. For example the [aws.Bool](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#Bool) function to get the address from a bool literal. Similar utilities are available for all other primitive types in the [aws](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws) package.

  * Bug Fix: Fix incorrectly modeled Amazon EC2 number and boolean members in structures. The Amazon EC2 API client has been updated with a breaking change to fix all structure number and boolean members to be pointer types instead of value types. Fixes [#1107](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1107), [#1178](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1178), and [#1190](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1190). This breaking change is made within the major version of the client' module, because the client operations failed and were unusable with value type number and boolean members with the EC2 API.

# Release 2021-01-19

We are excited to announce the [General Availability](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-for-go-version-2-general-availability/)
(GA) release of the [AWS SDK for Go version 2 (v2)](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).
This release follows the [Release candidate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-for-go-version-2-v2-release-candidate)
of the AWS SDK for Go v2. Version 2 incorporates customer feedback from version 1 and takes advantage of modern Go language features.

## Breaking Changes
* `aws`: Updated Config.Retryer member to be a func that returns aws.Retryer ([#1033](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1033))
    * Updates the SDK's references to Config.Retryer to be a function that returns aws.Retryer value. This ensures that custom retry options specified in the `aws.Config` are scoped to individual client instances. 
    * All API clients created with the config will call the `Config.Retryer` function to get an aws.Retryer.
    * Removes duplicate `Retryer` interface from `retry` package. Single definition is `aws.Retryer` now.
* `aws/middleware`: Updates `AddAttemptClockSkewMiddleware` to use appropriate `AddRecordResponseTiming` naming ([#1031](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1031))
    * Removes `ResponseMetadata` struct type, and adds its members to middleware metadata directly, to improve discoverability.
* `config`: Updated the `WithRetryer` helper to take a function that returns an aws.Retryer ([#1033](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1033))
    * All API clients created with the config will call the `Config.Retryer` function to get an aws.Retryer.
* `API Clients`: Fix SDK's API client enum constant name generation to have expected casing ([#1020](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1020))
    * This updates of the generated enum const value names in API client's `types` package to have the expected casing. Prior to this, enum names were being generated with lowercase names instead of camel case. 
* `API Clients`: Updates SDK's API client request middleware stack values to be scoped to individual operation call ([#1019](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1019))
    * The API client request middleware stack values were mistakenly allowed to escape to nested API operation calls. This broke the SDK's presigners.
    * Stack values that should not escape are not scoped to the individual operation call.
* `Multiple API Clients`: Unexported the API client's `WithEndpointResolver` this type wasn't intended to be exported ([#1051](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1051))
    * Using the `aws.Config.EndpointResolver` member for setting custom endpoint resolver instead.

## New Features
* `service/sts`: Add support for presigning GetCallerIdentity operation ([#1030](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1030))
    * Adds a PresignClient to the `sts` API client module. Use PresignGetCallerIdentity to obtain presigned URLs for the create presigned URLs for the GetCallerIdentity operation.
    * Fixes [#1021](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1021)
* `aws/retry`: Add package documentation for retry package ([#1033](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1033))
    * Adds documentation for the retry package 

## Bug Fixes
* `Multiple API Clients`: Fix SDK's generated serde for unmodeled operation input/output ([#1050](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1050))
    * Fixes [#1047](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1047) by fixing the how the SDKs generated serialization and deserialization of API operations that did not have modeled input or output types. This caused the SDK to incorrectly attempt to deserialize response documents that were either empty, or contained unexpected data.
* `service/s3`: Fix Tagging parameter not serialized correctly for presigned PutObject requests ([#1017](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1017))
    * Fixes the Tagging parameter incorrectly being serialized to the URL's query string instead of being signed as a HTTP request header.
    * When using PresignPutObject make sure to add all signed headers returned by the method to your down stream's HTTP client's request. These headers must be included in the request, or the request will fail with signature errors.
    * Fixes [#1016](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1016)
* `service/s3`: Fix Unmarshaling `GetObjectAcl` operation's Grantee type response ([#1034](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1034))
    * Updates the SDK's codegen for correctly deserializing XML attributes in tags with XML namespaces.
    * Fixes [#1013](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/1013)
* `service/s3`: Fix Unmarshaling `GetBucketLocation` operation's response ([#1027](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1027))
    * Fixes [#908](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/908)

## Migrating from v2 preview SDK's v0.31.0 to v1.0.0

### aws.Config Retryer member

If your application sets the `Config.Retryer` member the application will need
to be updated to set a function that returns an `aws.Retryer`. In addition, if
your application used the `config.WithRetryer` helper a function that returns
an `aws.Retryer` needs to be used.

If your application used the `retry.Retryer` type, update to using the
`aws.Retryer` type instead.

### API Client enum value names

If your application used the enum values in the API Client's `types` package between v0.31.0 and the latest version of the client module you may need to update the naming of the enum value. The enum value name casing were updated to camel case instead lowercased.

## Migrating from v2 preview SDK's v0.30.0 to v0.31.0 release candidate

### smithy-go module relocation

If your application uses `smithy-go` utilities for request pipeline your application will need to be updated to refer to the new import path of `github.com/aws/smithy-go`. If you application did *not* use `smithy-go` utilities directly, your application will update automatically.

### EC2 IMDS module relocation

If your application used the `ec2imds` module, it has been relocated to `feature/ec2/imds`. Your application will need to update to the new import path, `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/ec2/imds`.

### CredentialsCache Constructor and ExpiryWindow Options

The `aws#CredentialsCache` type was updated, and a new constructor function, `NewCredentialsCache` was added. This function needs to be used to initialize the `CredentialCache`. The constructor also has function options to specify additional configuration, e.g. ExpiryWindow and Jitter.

If your application was specifying the `ExpiryWindow` with the `credentials/stscreds#AssumeRoleOptions`, `credentials/stscreds#WebIdentityRoleOptions`, `credentials/processcreds#Options`, or `credentials/ec2rolecrds#Options` types the `ExpiryWindow` option will need to specified on the `CredentialsCache` constructor instead.

### AWS Sigv4 Signer Refactor

The `aws/signer/v4` package's `Signer.SignHTTP` and `Signer.PresignHTTP` methods were updated to take functional options. If your application provided a custom implementation for API client's `HTTPSignerV4` or `HTTPPresignerV4` interfaces, that implementation will need to be updated for the new function signature.

### Configuration Loading

The `config#LoadDefaultConfig` function has been updated to require a `context.Context` as the first parameter, with additional optional function options as variadic additional arguments. Your application will need to update its usage of `LoadDefaultConfig` to pass in `context.Context` as the first parameter. If your application used the `With...` helpers those should continue to work without issue.

The v2 SDK corrects its behavior to be inline with the AWS CLI and other AWS SDKs. Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html for more information how to use the shared config and credentials files.


# Release 2020-11-30

## Breaking Change
* `codegen`: Add support for slice and maps generated with value members instead of pointer ([#887](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/887))
    * This update allow the SDK's code generation to be aware of API shapes and members that are not nullable, and can be rendered as value types by the code generation instead of pointer types.
    * Several API client parameter types will change from pointer members to value members for slice, map, number and bool member types.
    * See Migration notes for migrating to v0.30.0 with this change.

* `config`: Default to TLS 1.2 for HTTPS requests ([#892](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/892))
    * Updates the SDK's default HTTP client to use TLS 1.2 as the minimum TLS version for all HTTPS requests by default.

## Bug Fixes
* `config`: Fix AWS_CA_BUNDLE usage while loading default config ([#912](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/))
    * Fixes the `LoadDefaultConfig`'s configuration provider order to correctly load a custom HTTP client prior to configuring the client for `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable.
* `service/s3`: Fix signature mismatch error for s3 ([#913](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/913))
    * Fixes ([#883](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/883))

## Service Client Highlights
* Pagination support has been added to supported APIs. See [Using Operation Paginators](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/making-requests/#using-operation-paginators) in the Developer Guide. ([#885](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/885))
* Logging support has been added to service clients. See [Logging](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/logging/) in the Developer Guide. ([#872](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/872))
* `service`: Add support for pre-signed URL clients for S3, RDS, EC2 service ([#888](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/888))
    * `service/s3`: operations `PutObject` and `GetObject` are now supported with s3 pre-signed url client.
    * `service/ec2`: operation `CopySnapshot` is now supported with ec2 pre-signed url client.

## Migrating from v2 preview SDK's v0.29.0 to v0.30.0

### aws.BuildableHTTPClient move
The `aws`'s `BuildableHTTPClient` HTTP client implementation was moved to `aws/transport/http` as `BuildableClient`. If your application used the `aws.BuildableHTTPClient` type, update it to use the `BuildableClient` in the `aws/transport/http` package.

### Slice and Map API member types
This release includes several code generation updates for API client's slice map members. Using API modeling metadata the Slice and map members are now generated as value types instead of pointer types. For your application this means that for these types, the SDK no longer will have pointer member types, and have value member types.

To migrate to this change you'll need to remove the pointer handling for slice and map members, and instead use value type handling of the member values.

### Boolean and Number API member types
Similar to the slice and map API member types being generated as value, the SDK's code generation now has metadata where the SDK can generate boolean and number members as value type instead of pointer types.

To migrate to this change you'll need to remove the pointer handling for numbers and boolean member types, and instead use value handling.

# Release 2020-09-28
## Announcements
We’re happy to share the updated clients for the v0.25.0 preview version of the AWS SDK for Go V2.

The updated clients leverage new developments and advancements within AWS and the Go software ecosystem at large since
our original preview announcement. Using the new clients will be a bit different than before. The key differences are:
simplified API operation invocation, performance improvements, support for error wrapping, and a new middleware architecture.
So below we have a guided walkthrough to help try it out and share your feedback in order to better influence the features
you’d like to see in the GA version.

See [Announcement Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/client-updates-in-the-preview-version-of-the-aws-sdk-for-go-v2/) for more details.

## Service Client Highlights
* Initial service clients released at version `v0.1.0`
## Core SDK Highlights
* SDK core module released at `v0.25.0`
* `config` module released at `v0.1.0`
* `credentials` module released at `v0.1.0`
* `ec2imds` module released at `v0.1.0`

## Migrating from v2 preview SDK's v0.24.0 to v0.25.0

#### Design changes

The v2 preview SDK `v0.25.0` release represents a significant stepping stone bringing the v2 SDK closer to its target design and usability. This release includes significant breaking changes to the v2 preview SDK. The updates in the `v0.25.0` release focus on refactoring and modularization of the SDK’s API clients to use the new [client design](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/438), updated request pipeline (aka [middleware](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/awslabs/smithy-go/middleware)), refactored [credential providers](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials), and [configuration loading](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config) packages.

We've also bumped the minimum supported Go version with this release. Starting with v0.25.0 the SDK requires a minimum version of Go `v1.15`.

As a part of the refactoring done to v2 preview SDK some components have not been included in this update. The following is a non exhaustive list of features that are not available.

* API Paginators - [#439](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/439)
* API Waiters - [#442](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/442)
* Presign URL - [#794](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/794)
* Amazon S3 Upload and Download manager - [#802](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/802)
* Amazon DynamoDB's AttributeValue marshaler, and Expression package - [#790](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/790)
* Debug Logging - [#594](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/594)

We expect additional breaking changes to the v2 preview SDK in the coming releases. We expect these changes to focus on organizational, naming, and hardening the SDK's design for future feature capabilities after it is released for general availability.


#### Relocated Packages

In this release packages within the SDK were relocated, and in some cases those packages were converted to Go modules. The following is a list of packages have were relocated.

* `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/external` => `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config` module
* `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/ec2metadata` => `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/ec2imds` module

The `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials` module contains refactored credentials providers.

* `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/ec2rolecreds` => `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/ec2rolecreds`
* `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/endpointcreds` => `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/endpointcreds`
* `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/processcreds` => `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/processcreds`
* `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/stscreds` => `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/stscreds`


#### Modularization

New modules were added to the v2 preview SDK to allow the components to be versioned independently from each other. This allows your application to depend on specific versions of an API client module, and take discrete updates from the SDK core and other API client modules as desired.

* [github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config)
* [github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials)
* Module for each API client, e.g. [github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3)


#### API Clients

The following is a list of the major changes to the API client modules

* Removed paginators: we plan to add these back once they are implemented to integrate with the SDK's new API client design.
* Removed waiters: we need to further investigate how the V2 SDK should expose waiters, and how their behavior should be modeled.
* API Clients are now Go modules. When migrating to the v2 preview SDK `v0.25.0`, you'll need to add the API client's module to your application's go.mod file.
* API parameter nested types have been moved to a `types` package within the API client's module, e.g. `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3/types` These types were moved to improve documentation and discovery of the API client, operation, and input/output types. For example Amazon S3's ListObject's operation [ListObjectOutput.Contents](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3/#ListObjectsOutput) input parameter is a slice of [types.Object](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3/types#Object).
* The client operation method has been renamed, removing the `Request` suffix. The method now invokes the operation instead of constructing a request, which needed to be invoked separately. The operation methods were also expanded to include functional options for providing operation specific configuration, such as modifying the request pipeline.

```go
result, err := client.Scan(context.TODO(), &dynamodb.ScanInput{
    TableName: aws.String("exampleTable"),
}, func(o *Options) {
    // Limit operation calls to only 1 attempt.
    o.Retryer = retry.AddWithMaxAttempts(o.Retryer, 1)
})
```


#### Configuration

In addition to the `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/external` package being made a module at `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config`, the `LoadDefaultAWSConfig` function was renamed to `LoadDefaultConfig`.

The `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/defaults` package has been removed. Its components have been migrated to the `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws` package, and `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config` module.


#### Error Handling

The `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/awserr` package was removed as a part of the SDK error handling refactor. The SDK now uses typed errors built around [Go v1.13](https://golang.org/doc/go1.13#error_wrapping)'s [errors.As](https://pkg.go.dev/errors#As) and [errors.Unwrap](https://pkg.go.dev/errors#Unwrap) features. All SDK error types that wrap other errors implement the `Unwrap` method. Generic v2 preview SDK errors created with `fmt.Errorf` use `%w` to wrap the underlying error.

The SDK API clients now include generated public error types for errors modeled for an API. The SDK will automatically deserialize the error response from the API into the appropriate error type. Your application should use `errors.As` to check if the returned error matches one it is interested in. Your application can also use the generic interface [smithy.APIError](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/awslabs/smithy-go/#APIError) to test if the API client's operation method returned an API error, but not check against a specific error.

API client errors returned to the caller will use error wrapping to layer the error values. This allows underlying error types to be specific to their use case, and the SDK's more generic error types to wrap the underlying error.

For example, if an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) [Scan](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb#Scan) operation call cannot find the `TableName` requested, the error returned will contain [dynamodb.ResourceNotFoundException](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb/types#ResourceNotFoundException). The SDK will return this error value wrapped in a couple layers, with each layer adding additional contextual information such as [ResponseError](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/transport/http#ResponseError) for AWS HTTP response error metadata , and [smithy.OperationError](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/awslabs/smithy-go/#OperationError) for API operation call metadata.

```go
result, err := client.Scan(context.TODO(), params)
if err != nil {
    // To get a specific API error
    var notFoundErr *types.ResourceNotFoundException
    if errors.As(err, &notFoundErr) {
        log.Printf("scan failed because the table was not found, %v",
            notFoundErr.ErrorMessage())
    }

    // To get any API error
    var apiErr smithy.APIError
    if errors.As(err, &apiErr) {
        log.Printf("scan failed because of an API error, Code: %v, Message: %v",
            apiErr.ErrorCode(), apiErr.ErrorMessage())
    }

    // To get the AWS response metadata, such as RequestID
    var respErr *awshttp.ResponseError // Using import alias "awshttp" for package github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/transport/http
    if errors.As(err, &respErr) {
        log.Printf("scan failed with HTTP status code %v, Request ID %v and error %v",
            respErr.HTTPStatusCode(), respErr.ServiceRequestID(), respErr)
    }

    return err
}
```

Logging an error value will include information from each wrapped error. For example, the following is a mock error logged for a Scan operation call that failed because the table was not found.

> 2020/10/15 16:03:37 operation error DynamoDB: Scan, https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: ABCREQUESTID123, ResourceNotFoundException: Requested resource not found


#### Endpoints

The `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/endpoints` has been removed from the SDK, along with all exported endpoint definitions and iteration behavior. Each generated API client now includes its own endpoint definition internally to the module.

API clients can optionally be configured with a generic [aws.EndpointResolver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#EndpointResolver) via the [aws.Config.EndpointResolver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#Config.EndpointResolver). If the API client is not configured with a custom endpoint resolver it will defer to the endpoint resolver the client module was generated with.
