// AssumeRoleRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// AWS Security Token Service.
//
// Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access
// AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary
// credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security
// token. Typically, you use AssumeRole within your account or for cross-account
// access. For a comparison of AssumeRole with other API operations that produce
// temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
// and Comparing the AWS STS API operations (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call AssumeRole. You
// must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call AssumeRole.
//
// For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need
// to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials
// in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials
// and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming.
// Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account.
// Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts
// by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see
// IAM Roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// Session Duration
//
// By default, the temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole last
// for one hour. However, you can use the optional DurationSeconds parameter
// to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900
// seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role.
// This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view
// the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting
// for a Role (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)
// in the IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when you
// use the AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI commands. However
// the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console
// URL. For more information, see Using IAM Roles (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// Permissions
//
// The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to make
// API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call
// the AWS STS GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken API operations.
//
// (Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
// to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an
// inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to
// use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline
// and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies
// to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's
// permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and
// the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent
// AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You
// cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
// by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
// information, see Session Policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted
// by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy
// when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed
// to delegate that access to users in the account.
//
// A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions
// that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator
// must attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole for the ARN
// of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the
// role, then you can do either of the following:
//
//    * Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different
//    account).
//
//    * Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.
//
// In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users
// in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume
// the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies,
// see IAM Policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// Tags
//
// (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are
// called session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing
// Session Tags in STS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session
// tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you
// to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using
// Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during
// role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// Using MFA with AssumeRole
//
// (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
// when you call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure
// that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA
// device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes
// a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include
// valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition
// in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following
// example.
//
// "Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}
//
// For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html)
// in the IAM User Guide guide.
//
// To use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode
// parameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user's hardware or virtual
// MFA device. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that
// the MFA device produces.
