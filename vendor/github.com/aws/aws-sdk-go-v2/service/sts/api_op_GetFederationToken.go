// GetFederationTokenRequest returns a request value for making API operation for

//
// Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access
// key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user.
// A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials
// on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must
// call the GetFederationToken operation using the long-term security credentials
// of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those
// credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application.
// For a comparison of GetFederationToken with the other API operations that
// produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
// and Comparing the AWS STS API operations (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
// users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google,
// or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend
// that you use Amazon Cognito (http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.
// For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// You can also call GetFederationToken using the security credentials of an
// AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend
// that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then
// attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions
// and resources that they need to access. For more information, see IAM Best
// Practices (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// Session duration
//
// The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900
// seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default
// session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that
// are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration
// of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
//
// Permissions
//
// You can use the temporary credentials created by GetFederationToken in any
// AWS service except the following:
//
//    * You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.
//
//    * You cannot call any STS operations except GetCallerIdentity.
//
// You must pass an inline or managed session policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
// to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an
// inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to
// use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline
// and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
//
// Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy,
// then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass
// session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM
// user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way
// to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use
// session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in
// the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see Session
// Policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
// in the IAM User Guide. For information about using GetFederationToken to
// create temporary security credentials, see GetFederationToken—Federation
// Through a Custom Identity Broker (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken).
//
// You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based
// policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session
// in the Principal element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed
// by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions
// granted by the session policies.
//
// Tags
//
// (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called
// session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session
// Tags in STS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session
// tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you
// to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using
// Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html)
// in the IAM User Guide.
//
// Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
// means that you cannot have separate Department and department tag keys. Assume
// that the user that you are federating has the Department=Marketing tag and
// you pass the department=engineering session tag. Department and department
// are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request
// takes precedence over the user tag.
