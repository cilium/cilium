// AssociateAddressRequest returns a request value for making API operation for
// Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
//
// Associates an Elastic IP address with an instance or a network interface.
// Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account.
//
// An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in
// a VPC. For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html)
// in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
//
// [EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account] If the Elastic IP address is
// already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that
// instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an
// Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address,
// the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated
// to your account.
//
// [VPC in an EC2-Classic account] If you don't specify a private IP address,
// the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP address. If the
// Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance or a network
// interface, you get an error unless you allow reassociation. You cannot associate
// an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface that has an existing
// Elastic IP address.
//
// This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once,
// Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error, and you may be charged for each time
// the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For more information,
// see the Elastic IP Addresses section of Amazon EC2 Pricing (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/).
