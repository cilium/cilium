// Package ec2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Elastic Compute Cloud.
//
// Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides
// secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Using
// Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can
// develop and deploy applications faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon
// VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web
// Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual
// network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides
// block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly
// available
//
// and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and
// used like a hard drive. To learn more, see the following resources:
