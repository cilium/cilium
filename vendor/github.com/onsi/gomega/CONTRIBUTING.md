# Contributing to Gomega

Your contributions to Gomega are essential for its long-term maintenance and improvement.  To make a contribution:

- Please **open an issue first** - describe what problem you are trying to solve and give the community a forum for input and feedback ahead of investing time in writing code!
- Ensure adequate test coverage:
    - Make sure to add appropriate unit tests
    - Please run all tests locally (`ginkgo -r -p`) and make sure they go green before submitting the PR
- Update the documentation.  In addition to standard `godoc` comments Gomega has extensive documentation on the `gh-pages` branch.  If relevant, please submit a docs PR to that branch alongside your code PR.

Thanks for supporting Gomega!
