# This script performs disaster recovery of etcd from the backup data.
# Assumptions:
# - backup was done using etcdctl command:
#   a) in case of etcd2
#      $ etcdctl backup --data-dir=<dir>
#      produced .snap and .wal files
#   b) in case of etcd3
#      $ etcdctl --endpoints=<address> snapshot save
#      produced .db file
# - version.txt file is in the current directy (if it isn't it will be
#     defaulted to "2.2.1/etcd2"). Based on this file, the script will
#     decide to which version we are restoring (procedures are different
#     for etcd2 and etcd3).
# - in case of etcd2 - *.snap and *.wal files are in current directory
# - in case of etcd3 - *.db file is in the current directory
# - the script is run as root
# - for event etcd, we only support clearing it - to do it, you need to
#   set RESET_EVENT_ETCD=true env var.

# the current one and create a file with such configuration.
# The restore procedure is chosen based on this information.
