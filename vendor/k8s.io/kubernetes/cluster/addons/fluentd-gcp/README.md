# Stackdriver Logging Agent
==============

Stackdriver Logging Agent is a DaemonSet which spawns a pod on each node
that reads logs, generated by kubelet, container runtime and containers
and sends them to the Stackdriver. When logs are exported to the Stackdriver,
they can be searched, viewed, and analyzed.
