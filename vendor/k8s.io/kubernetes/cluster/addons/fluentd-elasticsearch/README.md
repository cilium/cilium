# Elasticsearch Add-On

This add-on consists of a combination of [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch],
[Fluentd][fluentd] and [Kibana][kibana]. Elasticsearch is a search engine
that is responsible for storing our logs and allowing for them to be queried.
Fluentd sends log messages from Kubernetes to Elasticsearch, whereas Kibana
is a graphical interface for viewing and querying the logs stored in
Elasticsearch.

**Note:** this addon should **not** be used as-is in production. This is
an example and you should treat is as such. Please see at least the
[Security](#security) and the [Storage](#storage) sections for more
information.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is deployed as a [StatefulSet][statefulSet], which is like
a Deployment, but allows for maintaining state on storage volumes. 

### Security

Elasticsearch has capabilities to enable authorization using
[X-Pack plugin][xPack]. See configuration parameter `xpack.security.enabled`
in Elasticsearch and Kibana configurations. It can also be set via
`XPACK_SECURITY_ENABLED` env variable. After enabling the feature,
follow [official documentation][setupCreds] to set up credentials in
Elasticsearch and Kibana. Don't forget to propagate those credentials also to
Fluentd in its [configuration][fluentdCreds], using for example
[environment variables][fluentdEnvVar]. You can utilize [ConfigMaps][configMap]
and [Secrets][secret] to store credentials in the Kubernetes apiserver.

### Initialization

The Elasticsearch Statefulset manifest specifies that there shall be an
[init container][initContainer] executing before Elasticsearch containers
themselves, in order to ensure that the kernel state variable
`vm.max_map_count` is at least 262144, since this is a requirement of
Elasticsearch. You may remove the init container if you know that your host
OS meets this requirement.

### Storage

The Elasticsearch StatefulSet will use the [EmptyDir][emptyDir] volume to
store data. EmptyDir is erased when the pod terminates, here it is used only
for testing purposes. **Important:** please change the storage to persistent
volume claim before actually using this StatefulSet in your setup!

## Fluentd

Fluentd is deployed as a [DaemonSet][daemonSet] which spawns a pod on each
node that reads logs, generated by kubelet, container runtime and containers
and sends them to Elasticsearch.

**Note:** in order for Fluentd to work, every Kubernetes node must be labeled
with `beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true`, as otherwise the Fluentd
DaemonSet will ignore them.

Learn more in the [official Kubernetes documentation][k8sElasticsearchDocs].

### Known problems

Since Fluentd talks to the Elasticsearch service inside the cluster, instances
on masters won't work, because masters have no kube-proxy. Don't mark masters
with a label mentioned in the previous paragraph or add a taint on them to
avoid Fluentd pods scheduling there.
