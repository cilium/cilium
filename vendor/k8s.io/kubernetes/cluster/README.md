# Cluster Configuration

##### Deprecation Notice: This directory has entered maintenance mode and will not be accepting new providers. Please submit new automation deployments to [kube-deploy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy). Deployments in this directory will continue to be maintained and supported at their current level of support.

The scripts and data in this directory automate creation and configuration of a Kubernetes cluster, including networking, DNS, nodes, and master components.

See the [getting-started guides](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides) for examples of how to use the scripts.

*cloudprovider*/`config-default.sh` contains a set of tweakable definitions/parameters for the cluster.

The heavy lifting of configuring the VMs is done by [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/).
