# Container-VM Image

[Container-VM Image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/vm-image/)
is a container-optimized OS image for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It is
primarily for running Google services on GCP. Unlike the open preview version
of container-vm, the new Container-VM Image is based on the open source
ChromiumOS project, allowing us greater control over the build management,
security compliance, and customizations for GCP.
