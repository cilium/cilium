# This script contains the helper functions that each provider hosting
# Kubermark must implement to use test/kubemark/start-kubemark.sh and
# test/kubemark/stop-kubemark.sh scripts.

# This function should create a machine instance for the master along
# with any/all of the following resources:
# - Attach a PD to the master (optionally 1 more for storing events)
# - A public IP address for the master ($MASTER_IP)
# - A network firewall rule allowing all TCP traffic on port 443 in master
#   Note: This step is compulsory in order for kubemark to work
#
# ENV vars that should be defined by the end of this function:
# 1. MASTER_IP
# 2. MASTER_NAME
#
# Recommended for this function to include retrying logic for the above
# operations in case of failures.
function create-master-instance-with-resources {
	echo "MASTER_IP: $MASTER_IP" 1>&2
	echo "MASTER_NAME: $MASTER_NAME" 1>&2

# This function should execute the command('$1') on the master machine
# (possibly through SSH), retrying in case of failure. The allowed number of
# retries would be '$2' (if not provided, default to single try).
function execute-cmd-on-master-with-retries() {

# This function should act as an scp for the kubemark cluster, which copies
# the files given by the first n-1 arguments to the remote location given
# by the n^th argument.
#
# Recommended for this function to include retrying logic in case of failures.
function copy-files() {

# This function should delete the master instance along with all the
# resources that have been allocated inside the function
# 'create-master-instance-with-resources' above.
