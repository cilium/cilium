This package contains hand-coded set implementations that should be similar to
the autogenerated ones in `pkg/util/sets`.

We can't simply use net.IPNet as a map-key in Go (because it contains a
`[]byte`).

We could use the same workaround we use here (a string representation as the
key) to autogenerate sets.  If we do that, or decide on an alternate approach,
we should replace the implementations in this package with the autogenerated
versions.

It is expected that callers will alias this import as `netsets`
i.e. `import netsets "k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/util/net/sets"`
