// PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an

// Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
// the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
// useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
// SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
// have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
//
// In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
// resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
// targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
//
// Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
// ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
// Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
// implementations.
//
// For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
// used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
// In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
// ancestor object referred to in this status.
//
// Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
// relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

// with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

	// an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
	// which to namespace this status.
