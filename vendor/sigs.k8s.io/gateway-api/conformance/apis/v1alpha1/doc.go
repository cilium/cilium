// V1alpha1 includes alpha maturity API types and utilities for creating and
// handling the results of conformance test runs. These types are _only_
// intended for use by the conformance test suite OR external test suites that
// are written in Golang and execute the conformance test suite as a Golang
// library.
//
// Note that currently all sub-packages are considered "experimental" in that
// they aren't intended for general use or to be distributed as part of a
// release so there is no way to use them by default when using the Golang
// library at this time. If you don't know for sure that you want to use these
// features, then you should not use them. If you would like to opt into these
// unreleased features use Go build tags to enable them, e.g.:
//
//   $ go test ./conformance/... -args ${CONFORMANCE_ARGS}
//
// Please note that everything here is considered experimental and subject to
// change. Expect breaking changes and/or complete removals if you start using
// them.
