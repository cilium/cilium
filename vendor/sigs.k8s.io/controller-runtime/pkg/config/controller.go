	// SkipNameValidation allows skipping the name validation that ensures that every controller name is unique.
	// Unique controller names are important to get unique metrics and logs for a controller.
	// Can be overwritten for a controller via the SkipNameValidation setting on the controller.
	// Defaults to false if SkipNameValidation setting on controller and Manager are unset.

	// GroupKindConcurrency is a map from a Kind to the number of concurrent reconciliation
	// allowed for that controller.
	//
	// When a controller is registered within this manager using the builder utilities,
	// users have to specify the type the controller reconciles in the For(...) call.
	// If the object's kind passed matches one of the keys in this map, the concurrency
	// for that controller is set to the number specified.
	//
	// The key is expected to be consistent in form with GroupKind.String(),
	// e.g. ReplicaSet in apps group (regardless of version) would be `ReplicaSet.apps`.
	GroupKindConcurrency map[string]int

	// MaxConcurrentReconciles is the maximum number of concurrent Reconciles which can be run. Defaults to 1.
	MaxConcurrentReconciles int

	// CacheSyncTimeout refers to the time limit set to wait for syncing caches.
	// Defaults to 2 minutes if not set.
	CacheSyncTimeout time.Duration

	// RecoverPanic indicates whether the panic caused by reconcile should be recovered.
	// Can be overwritten for a controller via the RecoverPanic setting on the controller.
	// Defaults to true if RecoverPanic setting on controller and Manager are unset.
	RecoverPanic *bool

	// NeedLeaderElection indicates whether the controller needs to use leader election.
	// Defaults to true, which means the controller will use leader election.
	NeedLeaderElection *bool

	// EnableWarmup specifies whether the controller should start its sources when the manager is not
	// the leader. This is useful for cases where sources take a long time to start, as it allows
	// for the controller to warm up its caches even before it is elected as the leader. This
	// improves leadership failover time, as the caches will be prepopulated before the controller
	// transitions to be leader.
	//
	// Setting EnableWarmup to true and NeedLeaderElection to true means the controller will start its
	// sources without waiting to become leader.
	// Setting EnableWarmup to true and NeedLeaderElection to false is a no-op as controllers without
	// leader election do not wait on leader election to start their sources.
	// Defaults to false.
	//
	// Note: This feature is currently in beta and subject to change.
	// For more details, see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/issues/3220.
	EnableWarmup *bool

	// UsePriorityQueue configures the controllers queue to use the controller-runtime provided
