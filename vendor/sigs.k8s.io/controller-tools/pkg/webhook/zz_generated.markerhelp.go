				Summary: "specify whether calling the webhook will have side effects. This has an impact on dry runs and `kubectl diff`: if the sideEffect is \"Unknown\" (the default) or \"Some\", then the API server will not call the webhook on a dry-run request and fails instead. If the value is \"None\", then the webhook has no side effects and the API server will call it on dry-run. If the value is \"NoneOnDryRun\", then the webhook is responsible for inspecting the \"dryRun\" property of the AdmissionReview sent in the request, and avoiding side effects if that value is \"true.\"",

Must be prefixed with a '/validate-' or '/mutate-' depending on the type, and followed by $GROUP-$VERSION-$KIND where all values are lower-cased and the periods in the group are substituted for hyphens.
