## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to
our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before
disclosing them in any public forums.

A threat model for Cilium and recommendations for running Cilium in production
environments can be found [here][threat-model]. Please ensure that you have
taken this threat model into consideration before making a report, including
considering the feasibility of an attack against a correctly secured
environment.

This is a private mailing list where members of Cilium's
[Security Team](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/roles/Security-Team.md)
are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.
