## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to
our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before
disclosing them in any public forums.

This is a private mailing list where members of Cilium's
[Security Team](https://github.com/cilium/community/blob/main/roles/Security-Team.md)
are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.
