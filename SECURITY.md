## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to
our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before
disclosing them in any public forums.

This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal
security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.
