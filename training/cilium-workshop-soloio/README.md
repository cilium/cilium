# Cilium training - Cilium and Gloo Mesh Workshop by Solo.io

## Training Workshop Description:
Cilium is an open source software for providing, securing and observing network connectivity between container workloads - cloud native, and fueled by the revolutionary Kernel technology eBPF.

In this workshop, we will review the following:

- Deployment of Cilium (including hubble) on a KinD Kubernetes cluster
- Deployment of the bookinfo application
- Looking at the service to service communication using the Hubble UI and then looking at the gRPC endpoint which provides the data used by the UI to build the graph
- Leveraging network policies to secure service to service communications 


This workshop also includes a certification option. This “Fundamentals for Cilium” credential, offered by Solo.io with Credly, certifies that you possess the essential skills to deploy the Cilium CNI on a test Kubernetes cluster, gather metrics and enforce network policies. At the completion of the workshop, you will be able to take an assessment and a score 80% or higher earns the certification.
