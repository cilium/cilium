### How do I use `cilium monitor`?

The `monitor` is a powerful tool for debugging networking traffic generated by cilium.
Although the output might look complex at the first sight, it will be easy to understand
after reading this answer.

`cilium monitor` can only be run with root privileges. It outputs all traffic coming in
and going out from endpoints, presenting an extensive detail to help you out figure it out
what's cilium doing to each packet.

This is an output of `cilium monitor` (*except the line numbers on the left side*)

Lines 1 to 5 show the first bytes of a packet before being processed by cilium. The packet
is truncated to the first 64 Bytes and the values seen here are the same ones if you see
with other tool such as tcpdump or Wireshark.

Lines 7 to 13 contains a descriptive message of the actions cilium is making to that
particular packet or decisions based on the packet value. For example, line 07 says: the
packet was processed on CPU 05, cilium mark the packet with the value `0x59e92ce5`, to help
reading the monitor messages, it's FROM endpoint `13949` and got a DEBUG message saying
`CT lookup: sport=52672 dport=6443 nexthdr=6 flags=0` from the bpf program.

Lines 14 to 21 shows the first 128 Bytes of the packets processed by the bpf cilium
program that is going to be delivered to the interface with index number `1420` (it says
at end of line 13).

The monitor also offers an option `-d` that is used to dissect the packets. For example,
the previous lines 1 to 6 and lines 14 to 21 will be replaced with something similar to this:

```
Ethernet        {Contents=[..14..] Payload=[..54..] SrcMAC=ba:16:f9:d4:27:28 DstMAC=1e:7c:15:d3:2f:6f EthernetType=IPv4 Length=0}

  Packet has been truncated
```

### The output of `cilium monitor` is too verbose I can't debug anything!

1) List your endpoints with `cilium endpoint list`.

2) For all endpoints that you **don't** want to debug, disable the debug logging messages.
For example, for endpoint 173: `cilium endpoint config 173 Debug=false`

3) Make sure debug is enabled for the endpoints you want to debug.
For example, for endpoint 29381:
```
$ cilium endpoint config 29381
Conntrack                Enabled
ConntrackAccounting      Enabled
Debug                    Enabled
DropNotification         Enabled
LearnTraffic             Disabled
NAT46                    Enabled
Policy                   Enabled
```

4) Run `cilium monitor`, it should be less verbose, containing only the debug messages for
the endpoints that you want to debug.

### How can I debug my policy tree?

Simple run `cilium policy allowed --source value --destination value` where value can be a
label or an label ID (**not endpoint ID**). If the value is a label, you can specify
multiple sources and/or multiple destinations.

Cilium outputs the tracing and the verdict for the given values for the policy tree on the
given node. For example: `cilium policy allowed -s 260 -d 261` outputs the following:

```
Resolving policy: From: [k8s:io.cilium.k8s.k8s-app.guestbook=web k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=default] => To: [k8s:io.cilium.k8s.k8s-app.guestbook=redis k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=default]
Root's [io.cilium] rules verdict: [undecided]
Searching in [io.cilium]'s children that have the coverage for: [[k8s:io.cilium.k8s.k8s-app.guestbook=redis k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=default]]
  Coverage found in [io.cilium.k8s], processing rules...
    Rule has no coverage: [Coverage: [k8s:k8s-app=kubernetes-dashboard] Allowing: [{always-accept reserved:host}]]
    Rule has no coverage: [Coverage: [k8s:k8s-app=kube-dns] Allowing: [{always-accept k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=kube-system} {always-accept k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=default} {always-accept reserved:host}]]
  No conclusion in [io.cilium.k8s] rules, current verdict: [undecided]
    Coverage found in [io.cilium.k8s.k8s-app], processing rules...
      Found coverage rule: [Coverage: [k8s:guestbook=redis] Allowing: [{always-accept k8s:guestbook=redis} {always-accept k8s:guestbook=web}]]
        No matching labels in allow rule: [{label: k8s:guestbook=redis, action: always-accept}]
        Found label matching [k8s:io.cilium.k8s.k8s-app.guestbook=web] in rule: [{label: k8s:guestbook=web, action: always-accept}]
Root's [io.cilium] children verdict: [always-accept]
Final verdict: [ACCEPT]
```

The output describes what's the verdict of a policy node and their respective rules. For
each policy node's children in the tree, it's added a space to help readability. The final
verdict shows the policy result, and therefore the policy being enforced on the current
node for the destination specified.

### I'm sure the policy I've created is correct but the endpoints can't reach each other, why?

There are numerous reasons for that to happen we can give you a basic walkthrough:

1) Is the destination machine reachable by the source machine? [Yes]
- If no, check the network connection between the machines.

2) Is there a firewall between them or a rule blocking the particular traffic? [No]
- If yes, add a rule to allow the particular traffic on the firewall.

3) If you are using cilium in VxLAN or GENEVE mode (`-t vxlan` or `-t geneve`) make sure
you are not blocking ports 4789, 8472 and 6081 tcp/udp on your firewall.

4) `cilium policy allowed -s sourceID -d destinationID` outputs `Final tree decision: accept`? [Yes]
- If no, check which labels the **source** has, with `cilium endpoint labels sourceID`, and
add a rule for them as consumers in the destination's policy tree.

5) `cilium monitor` outputs the traffic going out on the source node? [Yes]
- If it's too difficult to read the monitor output, check the F.A.Q. on how to use
`cilium monitor`. If the traffic is not going out, recompile the bpf program of the source
endpoint `cilium endpoint recompile endpointID`, and check again.

6) `cilium monitor` outputs the traffic going in on the destination node? [Yes]
- If it's too difficult to read the monitor output, check the F.A.Q. on how to use
`cilium monitor`. If the traffic is not going in, recompile the bpf program of the
destination endpoint `cilium endpoint recompile endpointID`, and check again.

### How can I see the data stored in the KV Store by cilium?

In **etcdv3**:
```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get --from-key=true "cilium-net"
```
or, with curl which is can be too verbose and the data is base64 encoded:

```
curl 'http://IP:2379/v3alpha/kv/range' -X POST -d '{ "key" : "AA==", "range_end" : "AA==" }'
```

In **consul v0.6.4**:

```
curl "http://IP:8500/v1/kv/cilium-net?recurse"
```
