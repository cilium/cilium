# egress-testds is a policy matching all traffic (i.e. destination CIDR
# 0.0.0.0/0) from the zgroup=testDS echo server pods.
#
# This policy is used to test that reply traffic from pods that are selected by
# an egress policy is not SNATed with the egress IP (only connections
# originating from these pods should go through egress gateway).
