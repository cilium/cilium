# Maintainers

See [Governance](Documentation/community/governance/commit_access.rst) for
governance, commit, and vote guidelines as well as maintainer responsibilities.
Everybody listed in this file is a committer as per governance definition.

All committers and maintainers have identical voting rights. Maintainers have
additional administrative and janitorial responsibilities.

Regardless of maintainer or committer status, any code contribution is subject
to code review requirements as per [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) and PRs get merged
by the "janitor role" which is rotated between all committers.
