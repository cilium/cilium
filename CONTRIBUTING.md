## Support Expectations & Enterprise Options

Cilium is an open source project maintained by the community, and we greatly appreciate all contributions that help improve it. If you find an issue or need a new feature, we encourage you to open an issue, submit a pull request, start a discussion, or join the weekly developer meeting.

However, if your organization requires stronger guarantees, priority support, or dedicated assistance, enterprise support is available from vendors in the ecosystem. You can find more details on the [website](https://cilium.io/enterprise/).
