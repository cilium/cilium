// Each connection is assumed to be called from a single thread, so accessing connection metadata

//
// OnData gets all the unparsed data the datapath has received so far. The data is provided to the parser
// associated with the connection, and the parser is expected to find if the data frame contains enough data
// to make a PASS/DROP decision for the whole data frame. Note that the whole data frame need not be received,
// if the decision including the length of the data frame in bytes can be determined based on the beginning of
// the data frame only (e.g., headers including the length of the data frame). The parser returns a decision
// with the number of bytes on which the decision applies. If more data is available, then the parser will be
// called again with the remaining data. Parser needs to return MORE if a decision can't be made with
// the available data, including the minimum number of additional bytes that is needed before the parser is
// called again.
//
// The parser can also inject at arbitrary points in the data stream. This is indecated by an INJECT operation
// with the number of bytes to be injected. The actual bytes to be injected are provided via an Inject()
// callback prior to returning the INJECT operation. The Inject() callback operates on a limited size buffer
// provided by the datapath, and multiple INJECT operations may be needed to inject large amounts of data.
// Since we get the data on one direction at a time, any frames to be injected in the reverse direction
// are placed in the reverse direction buffer, from where the datapath injects the data before calling
// us again for the reverse direction input.
