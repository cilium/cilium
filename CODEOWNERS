# Code owners are used by the Cilium community to consolidate common knowledge
# into teams that can provide consistent and actionable feedback to
# contributors. This section will describe groups of teams and suggestions
# about the focus areas for review.
#
# The primary motivation for these teams is to provide structure around review
# processes to ensure that contributors know how to reach out to community
# members to conduct discussions, ensure contributions meet the expectations of
# the community, and align on the direction of proposed changes. Furthermore,
# while these teams are primarily drawn upon to provide review on specific pull
# requests, they are also encouraged to self-organize around how to make
# improvements to their areas of the Cilium project over time.
#
# Any committer may self-nominate to code owner teams. Reach out to the core
# team on the #committers channel in Slack to coordinate. Committers do not
# require expert knowledge in an area in order to join a code owner team,
# only a willingness to engage in discussions and learn about the area.
#
# Project-wide
# ++++++++++++
#
# These code owners may provide feedback for Pull Requests submitted to any
# repository in the Cilium project:
#
# - @cilium/api:
#   Ensure the backwards-compatibility of Cilium REST and gRPC APIs, excluding
#   Hubble which is owned by @cilium/sig-hubble-api.
# - @cilium/build:
#   Provide feedback on languages and scripting used for build and packaging
#   system: Make, Shell, Docker.
# - @cilium/cli:
#   Provide user experience feedback on changes to Command-Line Interfaces.
#   These owners are a stand-in for the user community to bring a user
#   perspective to the review process. Consider how information is presented,
#   consistency of flags and options.
# - @cilium/ci-structure:
#   Provide guidance around the best use of Cilium project continuous
#   integration and testing infrastructure, including GitHub actions, VM
#   helpers, testing frameworks, etc.
# - @cilium/community:
#   Maintain files that refer to Cilium community users such as USERS.md.
# - @cilium/contributing:
#   Encourage practices that ensure an inclusive contributor community. Review
#   tooling and scripts used by contributors.
# - @cilium/docs-structure:
#   Ensure the consistency and layout of documentation. General feedback on the
#   use of Sphinx, how to communicate content clearly to the community. This
#   code owner is not expected to validate the technical correctness of
#   submissions. Correctness is typically handled by another code owner group
#   which is also assigned to any given piece of documentation.
# - @cilium/sig-foundations:
#   Review changes to the core libraries and provide guidance to overall
#   software architecture.
# - @cilium/github-sec:
#   Responsible for maintaining the security of repositories in the Cilium
#   project by maintaining best practices for workflow usage, for instance
#   preventing malicious use of GitHub actions.
# - @cilium/helm:
#   Provide input on the way that Helm can be used to configure features. These
#   owners are a stand-in for the user community to bring a user perspective to
#   the review process. Ensure that Helm changes are defined in manners that
#   will be forward-compatible for upgrade and follow best practices for
#   deployment (for example, being GitOps-friendly).
# - @cilium/sig-hubble-api:
#   Review all Hubble API related changes. The Hubble API covers gRPC and
#   metrics endpoints. The team ensures that API changes are backward
#   compatible or that a new API version is created for backward incompatible
#   changes.
# - @cilium/metrics:
#   Provide recommendations about the types, names and labels for metrics to
#   follow best practices. This includes considering the cardinality impact of
#   metrics being added or extended.
# - @cilium/release-managers:
#   Review files related to releases like AUTHORS and VERSION.
# - @cilium/security:
#   Provide feedback on changes that could have security implications for Cilium,
#   and maintain security-related documentation.
# - @cilium/vendor:
#   Review vendor updates for software dependencies to check for any potential
#   upstream breakages / incompatibilities. Discourage the use of unofficial
#   forks of upstream libraries if they are actively maintained.
#
# Repository Owners
# +++++++++++++++++
#
# The following code owners are responsible for a range of general feedback for
# contributions to specific repositories:
#
# - @cilium/sig-hubble:
#   Review all Cilium and Hubble code related to observing system events,
#   exporting those via gRPC protocols outside the node and outside the
#   cluster. those event channels, for example via TLS.
# - @cilium/hubble-ui:
#   Maintain the Hubble UI graphical interface.
# - @cilium/tetragon:
#   Review of all Tetragon code, both for Go and C (for eBPF).
#
# The teams above are responsible for reviewing the majority of contributions
# to the corresponding repositories. Additionally, there are "maintainer" teams
# listed below which may not be responsible for overall code review for a
# repository, but they have administrator access to the repositories and so
# they can assist with configuring GitHub repository settings, secrets, and
# related processes. For the full codeowners for individual repositories, see
# the CODEOWNERS file in the corresponding repository.
#
# - @cilium/cilium-cli-maintainers
# - @cilium/cilium-maintainers
# - @cilium/cilium-packer-ci-build-maintainers
# - @cilium/ebpf-lib-maintainers

#
# Cloud Integrations
# ++++++++++++++++++
#
# The following codeowner groups provide insight into the integrations with
# specific cloud providers:
#
# - @cilium/alibabacloud
# - @cilium/aws
# - @cilium/azure
#
# Cilium Internals

#   configurations within the agent control plane, including Services,
#   ClusterIP, NodePorts, Maglev, local redirect policies, and
#   NAT46/NAT64.
# - @cilium/sig-policy:
#   Ensure consistency of semantics for all network policy representations.
#   Responsible for all policy logic from Kubernetes down to eBPF policymap
