* policy: Fix selector identity release for FQDN (#18166, @joestringer)
* Preserve tail call maps during resize to prevent drops during agent upgrade (#17744, @ti-mo)
* Prevent unmanaged pods in GKE's containerd flavors. *Important:* Users should update their node taints from `node.cilium.io/agent-not-ready=true:NoSchedule` to `node.cilium.io/agent-not-ready=true:NoExecute`. *Important:* During the first node reboot after the fix is applied pods may still get IPs from the default CNI as cilium-node-init is only run later in the node startup process.
