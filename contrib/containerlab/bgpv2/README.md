BGPv2 Labs
==========

Prerequisites
-------------

Few dependencies are required to run kubernetes kind cluster in container lab environment.

Please refer to installation guides below
- [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [Container-lab](https://containerlab.dev/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

Usage
-----

Each lab contains a 'Makefile' which can be used to deploy, destroy or reload lab as well as apply kubernetes resources.
- make deploy
- make destroy
- make reload

Version of Cilium in these labs is pinned to commit 8c97a2119d, since BGPv2 feature is not yet available in official release.
It can be overridden by VERSION environment variable.
