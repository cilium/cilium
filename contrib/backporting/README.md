Cilium Backporting Scripts
==========================

# check-stable - List commits that need stable backporting

`GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx check-stable`

The `check-stable` script is derived from `relnotes` and scans for PRs which
have been merged and marked with the label `stable/needs-backporting`. The
script will list those PRs and all non-merge commit ids that were part of the
merge. There are three columns: first one is the correlated sha of the commit
from the master branch, second one is the sha of the commit from the pull
request, and third column is the commit subject. The sha from the master
branch is then needed for backporting into downstream with the help of the
`cherry-pick` script.

## Example

1. Generate a GitHub developer access token. (User Profile -> Settings ->
   Developer Settings -> Personal access token -> Generate new token)

   The access token requires access to `public_repo`.

   If not already done, install `jq` on your system.

2. Run the script to generate the list of current backporting TODOs:

   `GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx `./check-stable`

   The list will be dumped to stdout.

# cherry-pick - Cherry-pick individual commits

`cherry-pick <commit-sha>`

After having run `check-stable`, the `cherry-pick` script takes an individual
commit sha as argument and adds the upstream commit into the downstream branch.
It will also add a note about the upstream commit id into the commit message
and the signed-off-by from the backporter.

## Example

1. Checkout one of the stable branches. Run `./check-stable` to get a TODO
   list of commits to backport.

2. Work through the list of commits dumped and pass a non-merge commit sha
   to `cherry-pick`:

   `./cherry-pick 479dd2d5a92a7035267bcdb91186c512ddd4379e`

3. Resolve conflicts whenever necessary, and continue with the next commit.
