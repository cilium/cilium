Configuration
*************

ConfigMap Options
-----------------

In the `ConfigMap` there are several options that can be configured according
to your preferences:

* ``debug`` - Sets to run Cilium in full debug mode, which enables verbose
  logging and configures eBPF programs to emit more visibility events into the
  output of ``cilium monitor``.

* ``enable-ipv4`` - Enable IPv4 addressing support

* ``enable-ipv6`` - Enable IPv6 addressing support

* ``clean-cilium-bpf-state`` - Removes all eBPF state from the filesystem on
  startup. Endpoints will be restored with the same IP addresses, but ongoing
  connections may be briefly disrupted and loadbalancing decisions will be
  lost, so active connections via the loadbalancer will break. All eBPF state
  will be reconstructed from their original sources (for example, from
  kubernetes or the kvstore). This may be used to mitigate serious issues
  regarding eBPF maps. This option should be turned off again after restarting
  the daemon.

* ``clean-cilium-state`` - Removes **all** Cilium state, including unrecoverable
  information such as all endpoint state, as well as recoverable state such as
  eBPF state pinned to the filesystem, CNI configuration files, library code,
  links, routes, and other information. **This operation is irreversible**.
  Existing endpoints currently managed by Cilium may continue to operate as
  before, but Cilium will no longer manage them and they may stop working
  without warning. After using this operation, endpoints must be deleted and
  reconnected to allow the new instance of Cilium to manage them.

* ``monitor-aggregation`` - This option enables coalescing of tracing events in
  ``cilium monitor`` to only include periodic updates from active flows, or any
  packets that involve an L4 connection state change. Valid options are
  ``none``, ``low``, ``medium``, ``maximum``.

* ``preallocate-bpf-maps`` - Pre-allocation of map entries allows per-packet
  latency to be reduced, at the expense of up-front memory allocation for the
  entries in the maps. Set to ``true`` to optimize for latency. If this value
  is modified, then during the next Cilium startup connectivity may be
  temporarily disrupted for endpoints with active connections.

Any changes that you perform in the Cilium `ConfigMap` and in
``cilium-etcd-secrets`` ``Secret`` will require you to restart any existing
Cilium pods in order for them to pick the latest configuration.

The following `ConfigMap` is an example where the etcd cluster is running in 2
nodes, ``node-1`` and ``node-2`` with TLS, and client to server authentication
enabled.

.. code:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: cilium-config
      namespace: kube-system
    data:
      # The kvstore configuration is used to enable use of a kvstore for state
      # storage. This can either be provided with an external kvstore or with the
      # help of cilium-etcd-operator which operates an etcd cluster automatically.
      kvstore: etcd
      kvstore-opt: '{"etcd.config": "/var/lib/etcd-config/etcd.config"}'

      # This etcd-config contains the etcd endpoints of your cluster. If you use
      # TLS please make sure you follow the tutorial in https://cilium.link/etcd-config
      etcd-config: |-
        ---
        endpoints:
          - https://node-1:31079
          - https://node-2:31079
        #
        # In case you want to use TLS in etcd, uncomment the 'trusted-ca-file' line
        # and create a kubernetes secret by following the tutorial in
        # https://cilium.link/etcd-config
        trusted-ca-file: '/var/lib/etcd-secrets/etcd-client-ca.crt'
        #
        # In case you want client to server authentication, uncomment the following
        # lines and create a kubernetes secret by following the tutorial in
        # https://cilium.link/etcd-config
        key-file: '/var/lib/etcd-secrets/etcd-client.key'
        cert-file: '/var/lib/etcd-secrets/etcd-client.crt'

      # If you want to run cilium in debug mode change this value to true
      debug: "false"
      enable-ipv4: "true"
      # If you want to clean cilium state; change this value to true
      clean-cilium-state: "false"

CNI
===

`CNI` - Container Network Interface is the plugin layer used by Kubernetes to
delegate networking configuration. You can find additional information on the
`CNI` project website.

.. note:: Kubernetes `` >= 1.3.5`` requires the ``loopback`` `CNI` plugin to be
          installed on all worker nodes. The binary is typically provided by
          most Kubernetes distributions. See section :ref:`install_cni` for
          instructions on how to install `CNI` in case the ``loopback`` binary
          is not already installed on your worker nodes.

CNI configuration is automatically being taken care of when deploying Cilium
via the provided `DaemonSet`. The script ``cni-install.sh`` is automatically run
via the ``postStart`` mechanism when the ``cilium`` pod is started.

.. note:: In order for the ``cni-install.sh`` script to work properly, the
          ``kubelet`` task must either be running on the host filesystem of the
          worker node, or the ``/etc/cni/net.d`` and ``/opt/cni/bin``
          directories must be mounted into the container where ``kubelet`` is
          running. This can be achieved with `Volumes` mounts.

The CNI auto installation is performed as follows:

1. The ``/etc/cni/net.d`` and ``/opt/cni/bin`` directories are mounted from the
   host filesystem into the pod where Cilium is running.

2. The file ``/etc/cni/net.d/05-cilium.conf`` is written in case it does not
   exist yet.

3. The binary ``cilium-cni`` is installed to ``/opt/cni/bin``. Any existing
   binary with the name ``cilium-cni`` is overwritten.

.. _install_cni:

Manually installing CNI
-----------------------

This step is typically already included in all Kubernetes distributions or
Kubernetes installers but can be performed manually:

.. code:: bash

    sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/network-plugins/cni-0799f5732f2a11b329d9e3d51b9c8f2e3759f2ff.tar.gz
    sudo tar -xvf cni-0799f5732f2a11b329d9e3d51b9c8f2e3759f2ff.tar.gz -C /opt/cni
    rm cni-0799f5732f2a11b329d9e3d51b9c8f2e3759f2ff.tar.gz


Adjusting CNI configuration
---------------------------

The CNI configuration file is automatically written and maintained by the
scripts ``cni-install.sh`` and ``cni-uninstall.sh`` which are running as
``postStart`` and ``preStop`` hooks of the Cilium pod.

If you want to provide your own custom CNI configuration file, set the
``CILIUM_CUSTOM_CNI_CONF`` environment variable to avoid overwriting the
configuration file by adding the following to the ``env:`` section of the
``cilium`` DaemonSet:

.. code:: bash

        - name: CILIUM_CUSTOM_CNI_CONF
          value: "true"

The CNI installation can be configured with environment variables. These
environment variables can be specified in the `DaemonSet` file like this:

.. code:: bash

    env:
      - name: "CNI_CONF_NAME"
        value: "05-cilium.conf"

The following variables are supported:

+---------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
| Option              | Description                          | Default                |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
| HOST_PREFIX         | Path prefix of all host mounts       | /host                  |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
| CNI_DIR             | Path to mounted CNI directory        | ${HOST_PREFIX}/opt/cni |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
| CNI_CONF_NAME       | Name of configuration file           | 05-cilium.conf         |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------------+

If you want to further adjust the CNI configuration you may do so by creating
the CNI configuration ``/etc/cni/net.d/05-cilium.conf`` manually:

.. code:: bash

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/cni/net.d
    sudo sh -c 'echo "{
        "name": "cilium",
        "type": "cilium-cni"
    }
    " > /etc/cni/net.d/05-cilium.conf'

Cilium will use any existing ``/etc/cni/net.d/05-cilium.conf`` file if it
already exists on a worker node and only creates it if it does not exist yet.

CRD Validation
==============

Custom Resource Validation was introduced in Kubernetes since version ``1.8.0``.
This is still considered an alpha feature in Kubernetes ``1.8.0`` and beta in
Kubernetes ``1.9.0``.

Since Cilium ``v1.0.0-rc3``, Cilium will create, or update in case it exists,
the Cilium Network Policy (CNP) Resource Definition with the embedded
validation schema. This allows the validation of CiliumNetworkPolicy to be done
on the kube-apiserver when the policy is imported with an ability to provide
direct feedback when importing the resource.

To enable this feature, the flag ``--feature-gates=CustomResourceValidation=true``
must be set when starting kube-apiserver. Cilium itself will automatically make
use of this feature and no additional flag is required.

.. note:: In case there is an invalid CNP before updating to Cilium
          ``v1.0.0-rc3``, which contains the validator, the kube-apiserver
          validator will prevent Cilium from updating that invalid CNP with
          Cilium node status. By checking Cilium logs for ``unable to update
          CNP, retrying...``, it is possible to determine which Cilium Network
          Policies are considered invalid after updating to Cilium
          ``v1.0.0-rc3``.

To verify that the CNP resource definition contains the validation schema, run
the following command:

``kubectl get crd ciliumnetworkpolicies.cilium.io -o json``

.. code:: bash

	kubectl get crd ciliumnetworkpolicies.cilium.io -o json | grep -A 12 openAPIV3Schema
            "openAPIV3Schema": {
                "oneOf": [
                    {
                        "required": [
                            "spec"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "required": [
                            "specs"
                        ]
                    }
                ],

In case the user writes a policy that does not conform to the schema, Kubernetes
will return an error, e.g.:

.. code:: bash

	cat <<EOF > ./bad-cnp.yaml
	apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
	kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
	metadata:
	  name: my-new-cilium-object
	spec:
	  description: "Policy to test multiple rules in a single file"
	  endpointSelector:
	    matchLabels:
	      app: details
	      track: stable
	      version: v1
	  ingress:
	  - fromEndpoints:
	    - matchLabels:
	        app: reviews
	        track: stable
	        version: v1
	    toPorts:
	    - ports:
	      - port: '65536'
	        protocol: TCP
	      rules:
	        http:
	        - method: GET
	          path: "/health"
	EOF

	kubectl create -f ./bad-cnp.yaml
	...
	spec.ingress.toPorts.ports.port in body should match '^(6553[0-5]|655[0-2][0-9]|65[0-4][0-9]{2}|6[0-4][0-9]{3}|[1-5][0-9]{4}|[0-9]{1,4})$'


In this case, the policy has a port out of the 0-65535 range.

Mounting BPFFS with systemd
===========================

Due to how systemd `mounts
<https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/283442/systemd-mount-fails-where-setting-doesnt-match-unit-name>`__
filesystems, the mount point path must be reflected in the unit filename.

        cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/sys-fs-bpf.mount

Container Runtimes
==================

.. _crio-instructions:

CRIO
----

If you want to use CRIO, generate the YAML using:

.. include:: ../../gettingstarted/k8s-install-download-release.rst

.. note::

   The helm ``--set containerRuntime.integration=crio`` might not be
   required for your setup. For more info see :ref:`crio-known-issues`.

.. parsed-literal::

   helm install cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
     --namespace kube-system \\
     --set containerRuntime.integration=crio

Since CRI-O does not automatically detect that a new CNI plugin has been
installed, you will need to restart the CRI-O daemon for it to pick up the
Cilium CNI configuration.

First make sure cilium is running:

::

    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
    NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP          NODE
    cilium-mqtdz       1/1       Running   0          3m       10.0.2.15   minikube

After that you can restart CRI-O:

::

    minikube ssh -- sudo systemctl restart crio

.. _crio-known-issues:

Common CRIO issues
------------------

Some CRI-O environments automatically mount the bpf filesystem in the pods,
which is something that Cilium avoids doing when
``--set containerRuntime.integration=crio`` is set. However, some
CRI-O environments do not mount the bpf filesystem automatically which causes
Cilium to print the follow message:

.. parsed-literal::

        level=warning msg="BPF system config check: NOT OK." error="CONFIG_BPF kernel parameter is required" subsys=linux-datapath
        level=warning msg="================================= WARNING ==========================================" subsys=bpf
        level=warning msg="BPF filesystem is not mounted. This will lead to network disruption when Cilium pods" subsys=bpf
        level=warning msg="are restarted. Ensure that the BPF filesystem is mounted in the host." subsys=bpf
        level=warning msg="https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/kubernetes/requirements/#mounted-bpf-filesystem" subsys=bpf
        level=warning msg="====================================================================================" subsys=bpf
        level=info msg="Mounting BPF filesystem at /sys/fs/bpf" subsys=bpf

If you see this warning in the Cilium pod logs with your CRI-O environment,
please remove the flag ``--set containerRuntime.integration=crio`` from
your helm setup and redeploy Cilium.
