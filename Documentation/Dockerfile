## Workaround odd behaviour of sphinx versionwarning extension. It wants to
## write runtime data inside a system directory.
## We do rely on this extension, so we cannot just drop it.

## Recent Git versions refuse to work by default if the repository owner is
## different from the user. This is the case on macOS, because we run the
## container with --user "uid:gid", and they differ from what Linux is used to
## (The gid from macOS seems to be 20, which corresponds to the "dialout" group
## in the container). We pass --user "uid:gid" to have the "install" command
## work in the workaround for versionwarning above.
## Tell Git that this repository is safe.
RUN  git config --global --add safe.directory /src
