Troubleshooting Cilium deployed with Argo CD
********************************************

There have been reports from users hitting issues with Argo CD. This documentation 
page outlines some of the known issues and their solutions.

Argo CD deletes CustomResourceDefinitions
=========================================

When deploying Cilium with Argo CD, some users have reported that Cilium-generated custom resources disappear,
causing one or more of the following issues:

- ``ciliumid`` not found (:gh-issue:`17614`)
- Argo CD Out-of-sync issues for hubble-generate-certs (:gh-issue:`14550`)
- Out-of-sync issues for Cilium using Argo CD (:gh-issue:`18298`)

Solution
--------

To prevent these issues, declare resource exclusions in the Argo CD ``ConfigMap`` by following `these instructions <https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#resource-exclusioninclusion>`__.

Here is an example snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

    resource.exclusions: |
     - apiGroups:
         - cilium.io
       kinds:
         - CiliumIdentity
       clusters:
         - "*"


Also, it has been reported that the problem may affect all workloads you deploy with Argo CD in a cluster running Cilium, not just Cilium itself.
If so, you will need the following exclusions in your Argo CD application definition to avoid getting “out of sync” when Hubble rotates its certificates.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ignoreDifferences:
      - group: ""
        kind: ConfigMap
        name: hubble-ca-cert
        jsonPointers:
        - /data/ca.crt
      - group: ""
        kind: Secret
        name: hubble-relay-client-certs
        jsonPointers:
        - /data/ca.crt
        - /data/tls.crt
        - /data/tls.key
      - group: ""
        kind: Secret
        name: hubble-server-certs
        jsonPointers:
        - /data/ca.crt
        - /data/tls.crt
        - /data/tls.key


.. note::
    After applying the above configurations, for the settings to take effect, you will need to restart the Argo CD deployments.

Helm template with serviceMonitor enabled fails
===============================================

Some users have reported that when they install Cilium using Argo CD and run ``helm template`` with ``serviceMonitor`` enabled, it fails.
It fails because Argo CD CLI doesn't pass the ``--api-versions`` flag to Helm upon deployment.

Solution
--------

This `pull request <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/8371>`__ fixed this issue in Argo CD's `v2.3.0 release <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.0>`__.
Upgrade your Argo CD and check if ``helm template`` with ``serviceMonitor`` enabled still fails.

.. note::

    When using ``helm template``, it is highly recommended you set
    ``--kube-version`` and ``--api-versions`` with the values matching your
    target Kubernetes cluster. Helm charts such as Cilium's often conditionally
    enable certain Kubernetes features based on their availability (beta vs
    stable) on the target cluster.

    By specifying ``--api-versions=monitoring.coreos.com/v1`` you should be
    able to pass validation with ``helm template``.
