Cilium Agent API
================

The following API flags are compatible with the ``cilium-agent`` flag
``enable-cilium-api-server-access``.

===================== ====================
Flag Name             Description
===================== ====================
DeleteEndpointID      Deletes the endpoint specified by the ID. Deletion is
                      imminent and atomic, if the deletion request is valid and
                      the endpoint exists, deletion will occur even if errors are
                      encountered in the process. If errors have been encountered,
                      the code 202 will be returned, otherwise 200 on success. All
                      resources associated with the endpoint will be freed and the
                      workload represented by the endpoint will be disconnected.It
                      will no longer be able to initiate or receive communications
                      of any sort.
DeleteFqdnCache       Deletes matching DNS lookups from the cache, optionally
                      restricted by DNS name. The removed IP data will no longer
                      be used in generated policies.
