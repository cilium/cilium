**************************
Kubernetes Ingress Support
**************************

Cilium uses the standard `Kubernetes Ingress`_ resource definition, with
an ``ingressClassName`` of ``cilium``. This can be used for path-based
routing and for TLS termination. For backwards compatibility, the
``kubernetes.io/ingress.class`` annotation with value of ``cilium``
is also supported.

.. Note::

    The ingress controller creates a service of LoadBalancer type, so
    your environment will need to support this.

Cilium allows you to specify load balancer mode for the Ingress resource:

- ``dedicated``: The Ingress controller will create a dedicated loadbalancer
  for the Ingress.
- ``shared``: The Ingress controller will use a shared loadbalancer for all
  Ingress resources.

Each load balancer mode has its own benefits and drawbacks. The shared mode saves
resources by sharing a single LoadBalancer config across all Ingress resources in
the cluster, while the dedicated mode can help to avoid potential conflicts (e.g.
path prefix) between resources.

.. Note::

    It is possible to change the load balancer mode for an Ingress resource.
    When the mode is changed, active connections to backends of the Ingress
    may be terminated during the reconfiguration due to a new load balancer
    IP address being assigned to the Ingress resource.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to enable the Ingress Controller in
an existing K8s cluster with Cilium installed.

Prerequisites
#############

* Cilium must be configured with NodePort enabled, using
  ``nodePort.enabled=true`` or by enabling the kube-proxy replacement with
  ``kubeProxyReplacement=true``. For more information, see :ref:`kube-proxy
  replacement <kubeproxy-free>`.
* Cilium must be configured with the L7 proxy enabled using ``l7Proxy=true``
  (enabled by default).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Default Value
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/loadbalancer-mode``
     - | The loadbalancer mode for the ingress.
       | Allows a per ingress override
       | of the default set in the Helm value
       | ``ingressController.loadbalancerMode``.
       | Applicable values are ``dedicated`` and
       | ``shared``.
     - | ``dedicated``
       | (from Helm chart)
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/service-type``
     - | The Service type for dedicated Ingress.
       | Applicable values are ``LoadBalancer``
       | and ``NodePort``.
     - ``LoadBalancer``
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/insecure-node-port``
     - | The NodePort to use for the HTTP Ingress.
       | Applicable only if ``ingress.cilium.io/service-type`` is ``NodePort``. If unspecified, a random
       | NodePort will be allocated by kubernetes.
     - unspecified
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/secure-node-port``
     - | The NodePort to use for the HTTPS Ingress.
       | Applicable only if ``ingress.cilium.io/service-type`` is ``NodePort``. If unspecified, a random
       | NodePort will be allocated by kubernetes.
     - unspecified
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/tcp-keep-alive``
     - | Enable TCP keep-alive. Applicable values
       | are ``enabled`` and ``disabled``.
     - ``enabled``
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/tcp-keep-alive-idle``
     - TCP keep-alive idle time (in seconds)
     - ``10``
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/tcp-keep-alive-probe-interval``
     - TCP keep-alive probe intervals (in seconds)
     - ``5``
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/tcp-keep-alive-probe-max-failures``
     - TCP keep-alive probe max failures
     - ``10``
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/websocket``
     - | Enable websocket passthrough support.
       | Applicable values are ``enabled`` and ``disabled``.
     - ``disabled``

Additionally, cloud-provider specific annotations for the LoadBalancer service
are supported.

By default, annotations with values beginning with:

* ``service.beta.kubernetes.io``
* ``service.kubernetes.io``
* ``cloud.google.com``

will be copied from an Ingress object to the generated LoadBalancer service objects.

This setting is controlled by the Cilium Operator's ``ingress-lb-annotation-prefixes``
config flag, and can be configured in Cilium's Helm ``values.yaml``
using the ``ingressController.ingressLBAnnotationPrefixes`` setting.

Please refer to the `Kubernetes documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer>`_
for more details.
