**************************
Kubernetes Ingress Support
**************************

Cilium uses the standard `Kubernetes Ingress`_ resource definition, with
an ``ingressClassName`` of ``cilium``. This can be used for path-based
routing and for TLS termination. For backwards compatibility, the
``kubernetes.io/ingress.class`` annotation with value of ``cilium``
is also supported.

.. Note::

    The ingress controller creates a Service of LoadBalancer type, so
    your environment will need to support this.

Cilium allows you to specify load balancer mode for the Ingress resource:

- ``dedicated``: The Ingress controller will create a dedicated loadbalancer
  for the Ingress.
- ``shared``: The Ingress controller will use a shared loadbalancer for all
  Ingress resources.

Each load balancer mode has its own benefits and drawbacks. The shared mode saves
resources by sharing a single LoadBalancer config across all Ingress resources in
the cluster, while the dedicated mode can help to avoid potential conflicts (e.g.
path prefix) between resources.

.. Note::

    It is possible to change the load balancer mode for an Ingress resource.
    When the mode is changed, active connections to backends of the Ingress
    may be terminated during the reconfiguration due to a new load balancer
    IP address being assigned to the Ingress resource.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to enable the Ingress Controller in
an existing K8s cluster with Cilium installed.

Prerequisites
#############

* Cilium must be configured with NodePort enabled, using
  ``nodePort.enabled=true`` or by enabling the kube-proxy replacement with
  ``kubeProxyReplacement=true``. For more information, see :ref:`kube-proxy
  replacement <kubeproxy-free>`.
* Cilium must be configured with the L7 proxy enabled using ``l7Proxy=true``
  (enabled by default).
* By default, the Ingress controller creates a Service of LoadBalancer type,
  so your environment will need to support this. Alternatively, you can change
  this to NodePort or, since Cilium 1.16+, directly expose the Cilium L7 proxy
  on the :ref:`host network<gs_ingress_host_network_mode>`.

   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/tls-passthrough``
     - | Enable TLS Passthrough mode for this Ingress.
       | Applicable values are ``enabled`` and ``disabled``,

       | accepted.
       |
       | Note that some conditions apply to TLS

       | TLS Passthrough works:
       | * A ``host`` field must be set in the Ingress
       | * Default backends are ignored
       | * Rules with paths other than ``/`` are ignored
       | If all the rules in an Ingress are ignored for
       | these reasons, no Envoy config will be generated
       | and the Ingress will have no effect.
       |
       | Note that this annotation is analogous to
       | the ``ssl-passthrough`` on other Ingress
       | controllers.
     - ``disabled``
   * - ``ingress.cilium.io/force-https``
     - | Enable enforced HTTPS redirects for this Ingress.
       | Applicable values are ``enabled`` and ``disabled``,
       | although boolean-style values will also be
       | accepted.
       |
       | Note that if the annotation is not present, this
       | behavior will be controlled by the
       | ``enforce-ingress-https`` configuration
       | file setting (or ``ingressController.enforceHttps``
       | in Helm).
       | 
       | Any host with TLS config will have redirects to
       | HTTPS configured for each match specified in the
       | Ingress.
     - unspecified

Additionally, cloud-provider specific annotations for the LoadBalancer Service
are supported.

By default, annotations with values beginning with:

* ``lbipam.cilium.io``
* ``nodeipam.cilium.io``
* ``service.beta.kubernetes.io``
* ``service.kubernetes.io``
* ``cloud.google.com``

will be copied from an Ingress object to the generated LoadBalancer Service objects.

This setting is controlled by the Cilium Operator's ``ingress-lb-annotation-prefixes``
config flag, and can be configured in Cilium's Helm ``values.yaml``
using the ``ingressController.ingressLBAnnotationPrefixes`` setting.

Please refer to the `Kubernetes documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer>`_
for more details.

.. _gs_ingress_host_network_mode:

Host network mode
#################
.. note::
  Supported since Cilium 1.16+

Host network mode allows you to expose the Cilium ingress controller (Envoy
listener) directly on the host network.
This is useful in cases where a LoadBalancer Service is unavailable, such
as in development environments or environments with cluster-external
loadbalancers.

.. note::
    * Enabling the Cilium ingress controller host network mode automatically disables the LoadBalancer/NodePort type Service mode. They are mutually exclusive.
    * The listener is exposed on all interfaces (``0.0.0.0`` for IPv4 and/or ``::`` for IPv6).

Host network mode can be enabled via Helm:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ingressController:
      enabled: true
      hostNetwork:
        enabled: true

Once enabled, host network ports can be specified with the following methods:

* Shared Ingress: Globally via Helm flags
    * ``ingressController.hostNetwork.sharedListenerPort``: Host network port to expose the Cilium ingress controller Envoy listener. The default port is ``8080``. If you change it, you should choose a port number higher than ``1023`` (see `Bind to privileged port`_).
* Dedicated Ingress: Per ``Ingress`` resource via annotations
    * ``ingress.cilium.io/host-listener-port``:  Host network port to expose the Cilium ingress controller Envoy listener. The default port is ``8080`` but it can only be used for a single ``Ingress`` resource as it needs to be unique per ``Ingress`` resource. You should choose a port higher than ``1023`` (see `Bind to privileged port`_). This annotation is mandatory if the global Cilium ingress controller mode is configured to ``dedicated`` (``ingressController.loadbalancerMode``) or the ingress resource sets the ``ingress.cilium.io/loadbalancer-mode`` annotation to ``dedicated`` and multiple ``Ingress`` resources are deployed.

The default behavior regarding shared or dedicated ingress can be configured via
``ingressController.loadbalancerMode``.

.. warning::
    Be aware that misconfiguration might result in port clashes. Configure unique ports that are still available on all Cilium Nodes where Cilium ingress controller Envoy listeners are exposed.

Bind to privileged port
***********************
By default, the Cilium L7 Envoy process does not have any Linux capabilities
out-of-the-box and is therefore not allowed to listen on privileged ports.

If you choose a port equal to or lower than ``1023``, ensure that the Helm value
``envoy.securityContext.capabilities.keepCapNetBindService=true`` is configured
and to add the capability ``NET_BIND_SERVICE`` to the respective
:ref:`Cilium Envoy container via Helm values<envoy>`:

* Standalone DaemonSet mode: ``envoy.securityContext.capabilities.envoy``
* Embedded mode: ``securityContext.capabilities.ciliumAgent``

Configure the following Helm values to allow privileged port bindings in host
network mode:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Standalone DaemonSet mode

      .. code-block:: yaml

          ingressController:
            enabled: true
            hostNetwork:
              enabled: true
          envoy:
            enabled: true
            securityContext:
              capabilities:
                keepCapNetBindService: true
                envoy:
                # Add NET_BIND_SERVICE to the list (keep the others!)
                - NET_BIND_SERVICE

    .. group-tab:: Embedded mode

      .. code-block:: yaml

          ingressController:
            enabled: true
            hostNetwork:
              enabled: true
          envoy:
            securityContext:
              capabilities:
                keepCapNetBindService: true
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              ciliumAgent:
              # Add NET_BIND_SERVICE to the list (keep the others!)
              - NET_BIND_SERVICE

Deploy Gateway API listeners on subset of nodes
***********************************************
The Cilium ingress controller Envoy listener can be exposed on a specific subset
of nodes. This only works in combination with the host network mode and can be
configured via a node label selector in the Helm values:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ingressController:
      enabled: true
      hostNetwork:
        enabled: true
        nodes:
          matchLabels:
            role: infra
            component: ingress

This will deploy the Ingress Controller Envoy listener only on the Cilium Nodes
matching the configured labels. An empty selector selects all nodes and
continues to expose the functionality on all Cilium nodes.
