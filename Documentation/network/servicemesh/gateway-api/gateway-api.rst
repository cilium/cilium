What is Gateway API?
####################

Gateway API is a Kubernetes SIG-Network subproject to design a successor for
the Ingress object. It is a set of resources that model service networking in
Kubernetes, and is designed to be role-oriented, portable, expressive, and
extensible.

See the `Gateway API site <https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/>`__ for more details.
