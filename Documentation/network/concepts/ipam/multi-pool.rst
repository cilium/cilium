Multi-Pool (Beta)
#################

.. include:: ../../../beta.rst

The Multi-Pool IPAM mode supports allocating PodCIDRs from multiple different IPAM pools, depending
on properties of the workload defined by the user, e.g. annotations.

Architecture
************

.. image:: multi-pool.png
    :align: center

When running in the Multi-Pool IPAM mode, Cilium will use the ``ipam.cilium.io/ip-pool`` annotation
on pods and namespaces to determine the IPAM pool from which a pod's IP is allocated from.

  1. If there is an ``ipam.cilium.io/ip-pool=A`` annotation on the pod itself, Cilium will
     allocate the pod's IP from the pool named ``A``.
  2. If there is no annotation on the pod, but the namespace of the pod has an
     ``ipam.cilium.io/ip-pool=B`` annotation, Cilium will
     allocate the pod's IP from the pool named ``B``.
  3. If neither the pod nor the namespace have a ``ipam.cilium.io/ip-pool`` annotation,
     the pod's IP will be allocated from the pool named ``default``.

The annotation is only considered when a pod is created. Changing the ``ip-pool``
annotation on an already running pod has no effect.

The ``CiliumNode`` resource is extended with an additional ``spec.ipam.pools`` section:

``spec.ipam.pools.requested``
  List of IPAM pool requests for this node. Each entry specifies the pool and the number of
  requested IP addresses. This field is owned and written to by the Cilium agent running on
  the particular node. It is read by the Cilium operator to fulfill the requests.

``spec.ipam.pools.allocated``
  List of CIDRs allocated to this node and the pool they were allocated from.
  Cilium operator adds new PodCIDRs to this field. Cilium agent removes PodCIDRs
  it has released and is no longer using.

IP pools are managed using the cluster-wide ``CiliumPodIPPool`` custom resource.
Each ``CiliumPodIPPool`` contains the cluster-wide CIDR from which per-node
PodCIDRs are allocated:

.. code-block:: yaml

  apiVersion: cilium.io/v2alpha1
  kind: CiliumPodIPPool
  metadata:
    name: green-pool
  spec:
    ipv4:
      cidrs:
        - 10.20.0.0/16
        - 10.30.0.0/16
      maskSize: 24
    ipv6:
      cidrs:
        - fd00::/104
      maskSize: 120

New pools can be added at run-time. The list of CIDRs in each pool can also be
extended at run-time. In-use CIDRs may not be removed from an existing pool, and
existing pools may not be deleted if they are still in use by a Cilium node.
The mask size of a pool is immutable and the same for all nodes. Neither restriction
is enforced until :gh-issue:`26966` is resolved.

Configuration
*************

Multi-Pool IPAM can be enabled using the ``ipam.mode=multi-pool`` Helm value.
To have the Cilium operator automatically create ``CiliumPodIPPools`` custom
resources at startup, use the ``ipam.operator.autoCreateCiliumPodIPPools`` Helm
value. It contains a map which follows the ``CiliumPodIPPools`` CRD schema
described above.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ipam:
    mode: multi-pool
    operator:
      autoCreateCiliumPodIPPools:
        default:
          ipv4:
            cidrs:
              - 10.10.0.0/16
            maskSize: 24
        other:
          ipv4:
            cidrs:
              - 10.20.0.0/16
            maskSize: 24

.. note::

  For a practical tutorial on how to enable this mode in Cilium, see
  :ref:`gsg_ipam_crd_multi_pool`.

Allocation Parameters
---------------------

Cilium agent can be configured to pre-allocate IPs from each pool. This behavior
can be controlled using the ``ipam-multi-pool-pre-allocation`` flag. It
contains a key-value map of the form ``<pool-name>=<preAllocIPs>`` where
``preAllocIPs`` specifies how many IPs are to be pre-allocated to the local
node. The same number of IPs are pre-allocated for each address family. This
means that a pool which contains both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs will pre-allocate
``preAllocIPs`` IPv4 addresses and ``preAllocIPs`` IPv6 addresses.

The flag defaults to ``default=8``, which means it will pre-allocate 8 IPs from
the ``default`` pool. All other pools which do not have an entry in the
``ipam-multi-pool-pre-allocation`` map are assumed to have a ``preAllocIPs`` of
zero, i.e. no IPs are pre-allocated for that pool.

Depending on the number of in-use IPs and the number of pending IP allocation
requests, Cilium agent might pre-allocate more than ``preAllocIPs`` IPs. The
formula Cilium agent uses to compute the absolute number of needed IPs from each
pool is:

.. code-block:: go

  neededIPs = roundUp(inUseIPs + pendingIPs + preAllocIPs, preAllocIPs)

Where ``inUseIPs`` is the number of IPs that are currently in use,
``pendingIPs`` number of IPs that have a pending pod (i.e. pods which have been
scheduled on the node, but not yet received an IP), and ``preAllocIPs`` is the
minimum number of IPs that we want to pre-allocate as a buffer, i.e. the value
taken from the ``ipam-multi-pool-pre-allocation`` map.

Limitations
***********

Multi-Pool IPAM is a preview feature. The following limitations apply to Cilium running in
Multi-Pool IPAM mode:

.. warning::
   - Tunnel mode is not supported. Multi-Pool IPAM may only be used in direct routing mode.
   - Transparent encryption is only supported with WireGuard and cannot be used with IPSec.
   - IPAM pools with overlapping CIDRs are not supported. Each pod IP must be
     unique in the cluster due the way Cilium determines the security identity
     of endpoints by way of the IPCache.
   - Multi-Pool IPAM does not support local node routes (``enable-local-node-route``) and
     requires the use of per-endpoint routes (see :ref:`native_routing`) instead.
   - iptables-based masquerading requires ``egressMasqueradeInterfaces`` to be set
     (see masquerading :ref:`masq_modes` and :gh-issue:`22273` for details).
     Alternatively, eBPF-based masquerading is fully supported and may be used instead.
     Note that if the used IPAM pools do not belong to a common native-routing CIDR,
     you may want to use ``ip-masq-agent``, which allows multiple disjunct non-masquerading
     CIDRs to be defined. See :ref:`concepts_masquerading` for details on how to use the
     ``ip-masq-agent`` feature.
   - Announcing PodCIDRs by way of the built-in :ref:`bgp` mode is not yet
     supported.  Use ``auto-direct-node-routes`` instead.
   - KVstore-based identity allocation mode is currently not supported (:gh-issue:`26621`)
