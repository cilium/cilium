Generic Release Process
-----------------------

This process applies to all releases other than feature releases, this includes:

* Stable releases

If you intent to release a new feature release, see the
:ref:`minor_release_process` section instead.

.. note:: The following commands have been validated when ran in the VM
          used in the Cilium development process. See :ref:`dev_env` for
          detailed instructions about setting up said VM.

#. Ensure that the necessary backports have been completed and merged. See
   :ref:`backport_process`.

   #. Update GitHub project and create ``vX.Y.Z+1`` project if applicable.
   #. Update PRs / issues that were added to the ``vX.Y.Z`` project, but didn't
      make it into this release into the ``vX.Y.Z+1`` project.

#. Checkout the desired stable branch and pull it:

   ::

       git checkout v1.0; git pull

#. Create a branch for the release pull request:

   ::

       git checkout -b pr/prepare-v1.0.3

#. Update the ``VERSION`` file to represent ``X.Y.Z+1``

#. Update the image tag versions and pullPolicy in the examples:

   ::

       make -C install/kubernetes clean all

#. Update the ``cilium_version`` and ``cilium_tag`` variables in
   ``examples/getting-started/Vagrantfile``

#. Update the ``AUTHORS file``

   ::

       make update-authors


   .. note::

       Check to see if the ``AUTHORS`` file has any formatting errors (for
       instance, indentation mismatches) as well as duplicate contributor
       names, and correct them accordingly.


#. Generate the release notes by running the instructions provided in github.com/cilium/release

#. Add the generated release notes in the ``CHANGELOG.md`` file

#. Create a new project named "X.Y.Z+1" to automatically track the backports
   for that particular release. `Direct Link: <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/new>`_

#. Update the project URL for the respective release in file ``.github/cilium-actions.yml``

#. Add all modified files using ``git add`` and create a pull request with the
   title ``Prepare for release v1.0.3``. Add the backport label to the PR which
   corresponds to the branch for which the release is being performed, e.g.
   ``backport/1.0``.

   .. note::

       Make sure to create the PR against the desired stable branch. In this
       case ``v1.0``


#. Follow standard procedures to get the aforementioned PR merged into the
   desired stable branch. See :ref:`submit_pr` for more information about this
   process.

#. Checkout out the stable branch and pull your merged changes:

   ::

       git checkout v1.0; git pull

#. Build the container images and push them

   ::

      DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=v1.0.3 make docker-image
      docker push cilium/cilium:v1.0.3

   .. note:

      This step requires you to login with ``docker login`` first and it will
      require your Docker hub ID to have access to the ``Cilium`` organization.
      You can alternatively trigger a build on DockerHub directly if you have
      credentials to do so.

#. Create release tags:

   ::

       git tag -a v1.0.3 -m 'Release v1.0.3'
       git tag -a 1.0.3 -m 'Release 1.0.3'

   .. note::

       There are two tags that correspond to the same release because GitHub
       recommends using ``vx.y.z`` for release version formatting, and ReadTheDocs,
       which hosts the Cilium documentation, requires the version to be in format
       ``x.y.z`` For more information about how ReadTheDocs does versioning, you can
       read their `Versions Documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/versions.html>`_.

#. Push the git release tag

   ::

       git push --tags

#. `Create a GitHub release <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/new>`_:

   #. Choose the correct target branch, e.g. ``v1.0``
   #. Choose the correct target tag, e.g. ``v1.0.3``
   #. Title: ``1.0.3``
   #. Check the ``This is a pre-release`` box if you are releasing a release
      candidate.
   #. Fill in the release description with the output generated by github.com/cilium/release

   #. Preview the description and then publish the release

#. Prepare Helm changes using the `Cilium Helm Charts Repository <https://github.com/cilium/charts/>`_
   and push the changes into that repository (not the main cilium repository):

   ::

      ./prepare_artifacts.sh /path/to/cilium/repository/checked/out/to/release/commit
      git push

#. Prepare Helm changes using the `Cilium Helm Charts Repository <https://github.com/cilium/charts/>`_
   for the vX.Y helm charts, and push the changes into that repository (not the main cilium repository):

   In the ``cilium/cilium`` repository:

   #. ``git checkout vx.y -b vx.z-dev``
   #. Change the ``VERSION`` file to ``x.y-dev``
   #. Run ``make -C install/kubernetes``

   In the ``cilium/charts`` repository:

   ::

      ./prepare_artifacts.sh /path/to/cilium/repository/checked/out/to/release/commit
      git push

   After pushing you can revert all the changes made in the local branch
   ``x.y-dev`` from ``cilium/cilium``.

#. Announce the release in the ``#general`` channel on Slack. Sample text:

   ::

      :cilium-new: **Announcement:** Cilium vX.Y.Z has been released :tada:

      <If security release or major bugfix, short summary of fix here>

      For more details, see the release notes:
      https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z

#. Create a new git branch based on the master branch to update ``README.rst``:

   ::

      git checkout -b pr/bump-readme-vX.Y.Z origin/master
      contrib/release/bump-readme.sh
      # (Commit changes & submit PR)

#. Bump the version of Cilium used in the Cilium upgrade tests to use the new release

   Please reach out on the ``#development`` channel on Slack for assistance with
   this task.

#. Update the ``stable`` tags for ``cilium``, ``cilium-operator``,
   ``cilium-docker-plugin`` and ``hubble-relay`` on DockerHub.

#. Update the external tools and guides to point to the released Cilium version:

    * `kubeadm <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/>`_
    * `kops <https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/>`_
    * `kubespray <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/>`_
