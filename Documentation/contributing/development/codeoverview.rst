Code Overview
=============

This section provides an overview of the Cilium & Hubble source code directory
structure. It is useful to get an initial overview on where to find what.

High-level
----------

Top-level directories `github.com/cilium/cilium <https://github.com/cilium/cilium>`_:

api
  The Cilium & Hubble API definition.

bpf
  The BPF datapath code

bugtool
  CLI for collecting agent & system information for bug reporting

cilium
  Cilium CLI client

contrib, tools
  Additional tooling and resources used for development

daemon
  The cilium-agent running on each node

examples
  Various example resources and manifests. Typically require to be modified
  before usage is possible.

hubble-relay
  Hubble Relay server

install
  Helm deployment manifests for all components

pkg
  Common Go packages shared between all components

operator
  Operator responsible for centralized tasks which do not require to be
  performed on each node.

plugins
  Plugins to integrate with Kubernetes and Docker

test
  End-to-end integration tests run in the :ref:`testsuite`.

Cilium
------

api/v1/openapi.yaml
  API specification of the Cilium API. Used for code generation.

api/v1/models/
  Go code generated from openapi.yaml representing all API resources

bpf
  The BPF datapath code

cilium
  Cilium CLI client

cilium-health
  Cilium cluster connectivity CLI client

daemon
  cilium-agent specific code

plugins/cilium-cni
  The CNI plugin to integrate with Kubernetes

plugins/cilium-docker
  The Docker integration plugin

Hubble
------

The server-side code of Hubble is integrated into the Cilium repository. The
Hubble CLI can be found in the separate repository `github.com/cilium/hubble
<https://github.com/cilium/hubble>`_. The Hubble UI can be found in the
separate repository `github.com/cilium/hubble-ui
<https://github.com/cilium/hubble-ui>`_.

api/v1/external, api/v1/flow, api/v1/observer, api/v1/peer, api/v1/relay
  API specifications of the Hubble APIs.

hubble-relay
  Hubble Relay agent

pkg/hubble
  All Hubble specific code

pkg/hubble/container
  Ring buffer implementation

pkg/hubble/filters
  Flow filtering capabilities

pkg/hubble/metrics
  Metrics plugins providing Prometheus based on Hubble's visibility

pkg/hubble/observe
  Layer running on top of the Cilium datapath monitoring, feeding the metrics
  and ring buffer.

pkg/hubble/parser
  Network flow parsers

pkg/hubble/peer
  Peer service implementation
