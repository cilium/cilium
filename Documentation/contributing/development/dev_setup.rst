You need to have the following tools available in order to effectively
contribute to Cilium:

For `unit_testing`, you will need to run ``docker`` without privileges. You can usually achieve this by adding your current user to the ``docker`` group.

To build the documentation, you will need to install its dependencies:

::

    $ sudo pip3 install -r Documentation/requirements.txt

Finally, in order to run Cilium locally on VMs, you need:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Dependency                                                                       | Version / Commit ID   | Download Command                                                               |

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You should start with the `gs_guide`, which walks you through the set-up, such
as installing Vagrant, getting the Cilium sources, and going through some
Cilium basics.


Vagrant Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the `gs_guide` uses a Vagrantfile tuned for the basic walk through, the
setup for the Vagrantfile in the root of the Cilium tree depends on a number of
environment variables and network setup that are managed via
``contrib/vagrant/start.sh``.

Using the provided Vagrantfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To bring up a Vagrant VM  with Cilium
plus dependencies installed, run:

::

    $ contrib/vagrant/start.sh

This will create and run a vagrant VM based on the base box
``cilium/ubuntu``. The box is currently available for the
following providers:

* virtualbox

Options
^^^^^^^

The following environment variables can be set to customize the VMs
brought up by vagrant:

* ``NWORKERS=n``: Number of child nodes you want to start with the master,
  default 0.
* ``RELOAD=1``: Issue a ``vagrant reload`` instead of ``vagrant up``, useful
  to resume halted VMs.
* ``NO_PROVISION=1``: Avoid provisioning Cilium inside the VM. Supports quick
  restart without recompiling all of Cilium.
* ``NFS=1``: Use NFS for vagrant shared directories instead of rsync.
* ``K8S=1``: Build & install kubernetes on the nodes. ``k8s1`` is the master
  node, which contains both master components: etcd, kube-controller-manager,
  kube-scheduler, kube-apiserver, and node components: kubelet,
  kube-proxy, kubectl and Cilium. When used in combination with ``NWORKERS=1`` a
  second node is created, where ``k8s2`` will be a kubernetes node, which
  contains: kubelet, kube-proxy, kubectl and cilium.
* ``NETNEXT=1``: Run with net-next kernel.
* ``IPV4=1``: Run Cilium with IPv4 enabled.
* ``RUNTIME=x``: Sets up the container runtime to be used inside a kubernetes
  cluster. Valid options are: ``docker``, ``containerd`` and ``crio``. If not
  set, it defaults to ``docker``.
* ``VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER={virtualbox \| libvirt \| ...}``
* ``VM_SET_PROXY=https://127.0.0.1:80/`` Sets up VM's ``https_proxy``.
* ``INSTALL=1``: Restarts the installation of Cilium, Kubernetes, etc. Only
  useful when the installation was interrupted.
* ``MAKECLEAN=1``: Execute ``make clean`` before building cilium in the VM.

If you want to start the VM with cilium enabled with ``containerd``, with
kubernetes installed and plus a worker, run:

::

	$ RUNTIME=containerd K8S=1 NWORKERS=1 contrib/vagrant/start.sh

If you want to get VM status, run:
::

  $ RUNTIME=containerd K8S=1 NWORKERS=1 vagrant status

If you want to connect to the Kubernetes cluster running inside the developer VM via ``kubectl`` from your host machine, set ``KUBECONFIG`` environment variable to include new kubeconfig file:

::

$ export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG:$GOPATH/src/github.com/cilium/cilium/vagrant.kubeconfig

and add ``127.0.0.1 k8s1`` to your hosts file.

If you have any issue with the provided vagrant box
``cilium/ubuntu`` or need a different box format, you may
build the box yourself using the `packer scripts <https://github.com/cilium/packer-ci-build>`_

Manual Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively you can import the vagrant box ``cilium/ubuntu``
directly and manually install Cilium:

::

        $ vagrant init cilium/ubuntu
        $ vagrant up
        $ vagrant ssh [...]
        $ cd go/src/github.com/cilium/cilium/
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/sysconfig/
        $ sudo cp contrib/systemd/cilium.service /etc/systemd/system/
        $ sudo cp contrib/systemd/cilium  /etc/sysconfig/cilium
        $ sudo usermod -a -G cilium vagrant
        $ sudo systemctl enable cilium
        $ sudo systemctl restart cilium

Notes
^^^^^

Your Cilium tree is mapped to the VM so that you do not need to keep manually
copying files between your host and the VM. Folders are by default synced
automatically using `VirtualBox Shared Folders <https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders>`_ .
You can also use NFS to access your Cilium tree from the VM by
setting the environment variable ``NFS`` (mentioned above) before running the
startup script (``export NFS=1``). Note that your host firewall must have a variety
of ports open. The Vagrantfile will inform you of the configuration of these addresses
and ports to enable NFS.

.. note::

   OSX file system is by default case insensitive, which can confuse
   git.  At the writing of this Cilium repo has no file names that
   would be considered referring to the same file on a case
   insensitive file system.  Regardless, it may be useful to create a
   disk image with a case sensitive file system for holding your git
   repos.

.. note::

   VirtualBox for OSX currently (version 5.1.22) always reports
   host-only networks' prefix length as 64.  Cilium needs this prefix
   to be 16, and the startup script will check for this.  This check
   always fails when using VirtualBox on OSX, but it is safe to let
   the startup script to reset the prefix length to 16.

.. note::

   Make sure your host NFS configuration is setup to use tcp:

   .. code-block:: none

      # cat /etc/nfs.conf
      ...
      [nfsd]
      # grace-time=90
      tcp=y
      # vers2=n
      # vers3=y
      ...

If for some reason, running of the provisioning script fails, you should bring the VM down before trying again:

::

    $ vagrant halt

Local Development in Vagrant Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`dev_env` for information on how to setup the development environment.

When the development VM is provisioned, it builds and installs Cilium.  After
the initial build and install you can do further building and testing
incrementally inside the VM. ``vagrant ssh`` takes you to the Cilium source
tree directory (``/home/vagrant/go/src/github.com/cilium/cilium``) by default,
and the following commands assume that you are working within that directory.

Build Cilium
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming you have synced (rsync) the source tree after you have made changes,
or the tree is automatically in sync via NFS or guest additions folder sharing,
you can issue a build as follows:

::

    $ make

Install to dev environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a successful build and test you can re-install Cilium by:

::

    $ sudo -E make install

Restart Cilium service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the newly installed version of Cilium, restart the service:

::

    $ sudo systemctl restart cilium

You can verify the service and cilium-agent status by the following
commands, respectively:

::

    $ sudo systemctl status cilium
    $ cilium status

Making Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Create a topic branch: ``git checkout -b myBranch master``
#. Make the changes you want
#. Separate the changes into logical commits.

   #. Describe the changes in the commit messages. Focus on answering the
      question why the change is required and document anything that might be
      unexpected.
   #. If any description is required to understand your code changes, then
      those instructions should be code comments instead of statements in the
      commit description.
#. Make sure your changes meet the following criteria:

   #. New code is covered by :ref:`unit_testing`.
   #. End to end integration / runtime tests have been extended or added. If
      not required, mention in the commit message what existing test covers the
      new code.
   #. Follow-up commits are squashed together nicely. Commits should separate
      logical chunks of code and not represent a chronological list of changes.
#. Run ``git diff --check`` to catch obvious white space violations
#. Run ``make`` to build your changes. This will also run ``go fmt`` and error out
   on any golang formatting errors.
#. See :ref:`unit_testing` on how to run unit tests.
#. See :ref:`testsuite` for information how to run the end to end integration
   tests

Add/update a golang dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets assume we want to add ``github.com/containernetworking/cni`` version ``v0.5.2``:

.. code:: bash

    $ go get github.com/containernetworking/cni@v0.5.2
    $ go mod tidy
    $ go mod vendor
    $ git add go.mod go.sum vendor/

For a first run, it can take a while as it will download all dependencies to
your local cache but the remaining runs will be faster.

Updating k8s is a special case, for that one needs to do:

.. code:: bash

    $ # get the tag we are updating (for example ``v0.17.3`` corresponds to k8s ``v1.17.3``)
    $ # open go.mod and search and replace all ``v0.17.3`` with the version
    $ # that we are trying to upgrade with, for example: ``v0.17.4``.
    $ # Close the file and run:
    $ go mod tidy
    $ go mod vendor
    $ make generate-k8s-api
    $ git add go.mod go.sum vendor/

Optional: Docker and IPv6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that these instructions are useful to you if you care about having IPv6
addresses for your Docker containers.

If you'd like IPv6 addresses, you will need to follow these steps:

1) Edit ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` and set the ``ipv6`` key to ``true``.

::

    {
      "ipv6": true
    }


If that doesn't work alone, try assigning a fixed range. Many people have
reported trouble with IPv6 and Docker. `Source here.
<https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29443#issuecomment-495808871>`_

::

    {
      "ipv6": true,
      "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8:1::/64"
    }


And then:

::

    ip -6 route add 2001:db8:1::/64 dev docker0
    sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1
    sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1


2) Restart the docker daemon to pick up the new configuration.

3) The new command for creating a network managed by Cilium:

::

    $ docker network create --ipv6 --driver cilium --ipam-driver cilium cilium-net


Now new containers will have an IPv6 address assigned to them.

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

Datapath code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tool ``cilium monitor`` can also be used to retrieve debugging information
from the BPF based datapath. Debugging messages are sent if either the
``cilium-agent`` itself or the respective endpoint is in debug mode. The debug
mode of the agent can be enabled by starting ``cilium-agent`` with the option
``--debug`` enabled or by running ``cilium config debug=true`` for an already
running agent. Debugging of an individual endpoint can be enabled by running
``cilium endpoint config ID debug=true``. Running ``cilium monitor -v`` will
print the normal form of monitor output along with debug messages:

.. code:: shell-session

   $ cilium endpoint config 731 debug=true
   Endpoint 731 configuration updated successfully
   $ cilium monitor -v
   Press Ctrl-C to quit
   level=info msg="Initializing dissection cache..." subsys=monitor

Passing ``-v -v`` supports deeper detail, for example:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ cilium endpoint config 3978 debug=true
    Endpoint 3978 configuration updated successfully
    $ cilium monitor -v -v --hex

One of the most common issues when developing datapath code is that the BPF
code cannot be loaded into the kernel. This frequently manifests as the
endpoints appearing in the "not-ready" state and never switching out of it:

.. code:: bash

    $ cilium endpoint list
    ENDPOINT   POLICY        IDENTITY   LABELS (source:key[=value])   IPv6                     IPv4            STATUS
               ENFORCEMENT
    48896      Disabled      266        container:id.server           fd02::c0a8:210b:0:bf00   10.11.13.37     not-ready
    60670      Disabled      267        container:id.client           fd02::c0a8:210b:0:ecfe   10.11.167.158   not-ready

Running ``cilium endpoint get`` for one of the endpoints will provide a
description of known state about it, which includes BPF verification logs.

The files under ``/var/run/cilium/state`` provide context about how the BPF
datapath is managed and set up. The .h files describe specific configurations
used for BPF program compilation. The numbered directories describe
endpoint-specific state, including header configuration files and BPF binaries.

Current BPF map state for particular programs is held under ``/sys/fs/bpf/``,
and the `bpf-map <https://github.com/cilium/bpf-map>`_ utility can be useful
for debugging what is going on inside them, for example:

.. code:: bash
