Jobs Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cilium-PR-Ginkgo-Tests-Validated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs validated Ginkgo tests which are confirmed to be stable and have been
verified. These tests must always pass.

The configuration for this job is contained within ``ginkgo.Jenkinsfile``.

It first runs unit tests using docker-compose using a YAML located at
``test/docker-compose.yaml``.

The next steps happens in parallel:

    - Runs the single-node e2e tests using the Docker runtime.
    - Runs the multi-node Kubernetes e2e tests against the latest default
      version of Kubernetes specified above.

This job can be used to run tests on custom branches. To do so, log into Jenkins and go to https://jenkins.cilium.io/job/cilium-ginkgo/configure .
Then add your branch name to ``GitHub Organization -> cilium -> Filter by name (with wildcards) -> Include`` field and save changes.
After you don't need to run tests on your branch, please remove the branch from this field.


Cilium-PR-Ginkgo-Tests-k8s
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the Kubernetes e2e tests against all Kubernetes versions that are not
currently not tested as part of each pull-request, but which Cilium still
supports, as well as the the most-recently-released versions of Kubernetes that
that might not be declared stable by Kubernetes upstream:

First stage.

    - 1.10
    - 1.11

Second stage (other versions)

    - 1.12
    - 1.13

Third stage

    - 1.14
    - beta versions (1.16-beta once it's out)

Ginkgo-CI-Tests-Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://jenkins.cilium.io/job/Ginkgo-CI-Tests-Pipeline/

Cilium-Nightly-Tests-PR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs long-lived tests which take extended time. Some of these tests have an
expected failure rate.

Nightly tests run once per day in the ``Cilium-Nightly-Tests Job``.  The
configuration for this job is stored in ``Jenkinsfile.nightly``.

To see the results of these tests, you can view the JUnit Report for an individual job:

1. Click on the build number you wish to get test results from on the left hand
   side of the ``Cilium-Nightly-Tests Job``.
2. Click on 'Test Results' on the left side of the page to view the results from the build.
   This will give you a report of which tests passed and failed. You can click on each test
   to view its corresponding output created from Ginkgo.

This first runs the Nightly tests with the following setup:

    - 4 Kubernetes 1.8 nodes
    - 4 GB of RAM per node.
    - 4 vCPUs per node.

Then, it runs tests Kubernetes tests against versions of Kubernetes that are currently not tested against
as part of each pull-request, but that Cilium still supports.

It also runs a variety of tests against Envoy to ensure that proxy functionality is working correctly.

.. _trigger_phrases:

Triggering Pull-Request Builds With Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that build resources are used judiciously, builds on Jenkins
are manually triggered via comments on each pull-request that contain
"trigger-phrases". Only members of the Cilium GitHub organization are
allowed to trigger these jobs. Refer to the table below for information
regarding which phrase triggers which build, which build is required for
a pull-request to be merged, etc. Each linked job contains a description
illustrating which subset of tests the job runs.

There are some feature flags based on Pull Requests labels, the list of labels
are the following:

- ``area/containerd``: Enable containerd runtime on all Kubernetes test.
- ``ci/next-next``: Run tests on net-next kernel. This causes the
  ``test-me-please`` target to only run on the net-next kernel. It is purely
  for testing on a different kernel, to merge a PR it must pass the CI
  without this flag.


Using Jenkins for testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically when running Jenkins tests via one of the above trigger phases, it
will run all of the tests in that particular category. However, there may be
cases where you just want to run a single test quickly on Jenkins and observe
the test result. To do so, you need to update the relevant test to have a
custom name, and to update the Jenkins file to focus that test. Below is an
example patch that shows how this can be achieved.

CI Failure Triage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the process to triage CI failures. We define 3 categories:

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Keyword              | Description                                                                       |
+======================+===================================================================================+
| Flake                | Failure due to a temporary situation such as loss of connectivity to external     |
|                      | services or bug in system component, e.g. quay.io is down, VM race conditions,    |
|                      | kube-dns bug, ...                                                                 |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CI-Bug               | Bug in the test itself that renders the test unreliable, e.g. timing issue when   |
|                      | importing and missing to block until policy is being enforced before connectivity |
|                      | is verified.                                                                      |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Regression           | Failure is due to a regression, all failures in the CI that are not caused by     |
|                      | bugs in the test are considered regressions.                                      |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Pipelines subject to triage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build/test failures for the following Jenkins pipelines must be reported as
GitHub issues using the process below:

+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Pipeline                              | Description                                                      |
+=======================================+==================================================================+
| `Ginkgo-Tests-Validated-master`_      | Runs whenever a PR is merged into master                         |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `Ginkgo-CI-Tests-Pipeline`_           | Runs every two hours on the master branch                        |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `Master-Nightly`_                     | Runs durability tests every night                                |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `Vagrant-Master-Boxes-Packer-Build`_  | Runs on merge into `github.com/cilium/packer-ci-build`_.         |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :jenkins-branch:`Release-branch <>`   | Runs various Ginkgo tests on merge into branch "\ |SCM_BRANCH|"  |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Triage process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Discover untriaged Jenkins failures via the jenkins-failures.sh script. It
   defaults to checking the previous 24 hours but this can be modified by
   setting the SINCE environment variable (it is a unix timestamp). The script
   checks the various test pipelines that need triage.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ contrib/scripts/jenkins-failures.sh

   .. note::

     You can quickly assign SINCE with statements like ``SINCE=`date -d -3days```

#. Investigate the failure you are interested in and determine if it is a
   CI-Bug, Flake, or a Regression as defined in the table above.

   #. Search `GitHub issues <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+>`_
      to see if bug is already filed. Make sure to also include closed issues in
      your search as a CI issue can be considered solved and then re-appears.
      Good search terms are:

      - The test name, e.g.
        ::

            k8s-1.7.K8sValidatedKafkaPolicyTest Kafka Policy Tests KafkaPolicies (from (k8s-1.7.xml))

      - The line on which the test failed, e.g.
        ::

            github.com/cilium/cilium/test/k8sT/KafkaPolicies.go:202

      - The error message, e.g.
        ::

            Failed to produce from empire-hq on topic deathstar-plan

#. If a corresponding GitHub issue exists, update it with:

   #. A link to the failing Jenkins build (note that the build information is
      eventually deleted).
   #. Attach the zipfile downloaded from Jenkins with logs from the failing
      tests. A zipfile for all tests is also available.
   #. Check how much time has passed since the last reported occurrence of this
      failure and move this issue to the correct column in the `CI flakes
      project <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/8>`_ board.

#. If no existing GitHub issue was found, file a `new GitHub issue <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/new>`_:

   #. Attach zipfile downloaded from Jenkins with logs from failing test
   #. If the failure is a new regression or a real bug:

      #. Title: ``<Short bug description>``
      #. Labels ``kind/bug`` and ``needs/triage``.

   #. If failure is a new CI-Bug, Flake or if you are unsure:

      #. Title ``CI: <testname>: <cause>``, e.g. ``CI: K8sValidatedPolicyTest Namespaces: cannot curl service``
      #. Labels ``kind/bug/CI`` and ``needs/triage``
      #. Include a link to the failing Jenkins build (note that the build information is
         eventually deleted).
      #. Attach zipfile downloaded from Jenkins with logs from failing test
      #. Include the test name and whole Stacktrace section to help others find this issue.
      #. Add issue to `CI flakes project <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/8>`_

   .. note::

      Be extra careful when you see a new flake on a PR, and want to open an
      issue. It's much more difficult to debug these without context around the
      PR and the changes it introduced. When creating an issue for a PR flake,
      include a description of the code change, the PR, or the diff. If it
      isn't related to the PR, then it should already happen in master, and a
      new issue isn't needed.

#. Edit the description of the Jenkins build to mark it as triaged. This will
   exclude it from future jenkins-failures.sh output.

   #. Login -> Click on build -> Edit Build Information
   #. Add the failure type and GH issue number. Use the table describing the
      failure categories, at the beginning of this section, to help
      categorize them.

   .. note::

      This step can only be performed with an account on Jenkins. If you are
      interested in CI failure reviews and do not have an account yet, ping us
      on Slack.

**Examples:**

* ``Flake, quay.io is down``
* ``Flake, DNS not ready, #3333``
* ``CI-Bug, K8sValidatedPolicyTest: Namespaces, pod not ready, #9939``
* ``Regression, k8s host policy, #1111``

Logging into VM running tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. If you have access to credentials for Jenkins, log into the Jenkins slave running the test workload
2. Identify the vagrant box running the specific test

.. code:: bash

    $ vagrant global-status
    id       name                          provider   state   directory

3. Log into the specific VM

.. code:: bash

    $ JOB_BASE_NAME=PR-1588 BUILD_NUMBER=6 vagrant ssh 6e68c6c


Jenkinsfiles Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cilium uses a custom `Jenkins helper library
<https://github.com/cilium/Jenkins-library>`_ to gather metadata from PRs and
simplify our Jenkinsfiles. The exported methods are:

- **ispr()**: return true if the current build is a PR.
- **setIfPr(string, string)**: return the first argument in case of a PR, if not
  a PR return the second one.
- **BuildIfLabel(String label, String Job)**: trigger a new Job if the PR has
  that specific Label.
- **Status(String status, String context)**: set pull request check status on
  the given context, example ``Status("SUCCESS", "$JOB_BASE_NAME")``
