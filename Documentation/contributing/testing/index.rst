Testing
=======

There are multiple ways to test Cilium functionality, including unit-testing
and integration testing. In order to improve developer throughput, we provide
ways to run both the unit and integration tests in your own workspace as opposed
to being fully reliant on the Cilium CI infrastructure. We encourage all PRs to 
add unit tests and if necessary, integration tests. Consult the following pages
to see how to run the variety of tests that have been written for Cilium, and 
information about Cilium's CI infrastructure.
