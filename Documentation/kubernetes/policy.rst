**************
Network Policy
**************

If you are running Cilium on Kubernetes, you can benefit from Kubernetes
distributing policies for you. In this mode, Kubernetes is responsible for
distributing the policies across all nodes and Cilium will automatically apply
the policies. Two formats are available to configure network policies natively
with Kubernetes:

- The standard `NetworkPolicy` resource which at the time of this writing,
  supports to specify L3/L4 ingress policies with limited egress support marked
  as beta.

- The extended `CiliumNetworkPolicy` format which is available as a
  `ThirdPartyResource` and `CustomResourceDefinition` which supports to specify
  policies at Layers 3-7 for both ingress and egress.

It is recommended to only use one of the above policy types at a time to
minimize unintended effects arising from the interaction between the
policies.

.. _CiliumNetworkPolicy:

CiliumNetworkPolicy
===================

The `CiliumNetworkPolicy` is very similar to the standard `NetworkPolicy`. The
purpose is provide the functionality which is not yet supported in
`NetworkPolicy`. Ideally all of the functionality will be merged into the
standard resource format and this CRD will no longer be required.

The raw specification of the resource in Go looks like this:

.. code-block:: go

        type CiliumNetworkPolicy struct {
                metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
                // +optional
                Metadata metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata"`

                // Spec is the desired Cilium specific rule specification.
                Spec *api.Rule `json:"spec,omitempty"`

                // Specs is a list of desired Cilium specific rule specification.
                Specs api.Rules `json:"specs,omitempty"`

                // Status is the status of the Cilium policy rule
                // +optional
                Status CiliumNetworkPolicyStatus `json:"status"`
        }

Metadata 
  Describes the policy. This includes:

    * Name of the policy, unique within a namespace
    * Namespace of where the policy has been injected into
    * Set of labels to identify resource in Kubernetes

Spec
  Field which contains a :ref:`policy_rule`
Specs
  Field which contains a list of :ref:`policy_rule`. This field is useful if
  multiple rules must be removed or added automatically.

Status
  Provides visibility into whether the policy has been successfully applied

Examples
========

See :ref:`policy_examples` for a detailed list of example policies.
