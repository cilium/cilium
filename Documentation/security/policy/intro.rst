Policy Enforcement Modes
========================

The configuration of the Cilium agent and the Cilium Network Policy determines whether an endpoint accepts traffic from a source or not. The agent can be put into the following three policy enforcement modes:

default
  This is the default behavior for policy enforcement. In this mode, endpoints
  have unrestricted network access until selected by policy. Upon being selected by
  a policy, the endpoint permits only allowed traffic. This state is per-direction
  and can be adjusted on a per-policy basis. For more details, :ref:`see the dedicated section on default mode<policy_mode_default>`.

always
  With always mode, policy enforcement is enabled on all endpoints even if no
  rules select specific endpoints.

  If you want to configure health entity to check cluster-wide connectivity when 
  you start cilium-agent with ``enable-policy: always``, you will likely want to
  enable communications to and from the health endpoint. See :ref:`health_endpoint`.

never
  With never mode, policy enforcement is disabled on all endpoints, even if
  rules do select specific endpoints. In other words, all traffic is allowed
  from any source (on ingress) or destination (on egress).

To :ref:`configure <k8s_configuration>` the policy enforcement mode, adjust the Helm value
``policyEnforcementMode`` or the corresponding configuration flag ``enable-policy``.

.. _policy_mode_default:

Endpoint default policy
-----------------------

By default, all egress and ingress traffic is allowed for all endpoints. When
an endpoint is selected by a network policy, it transitions to a default-deny
state, where only **explicitly allowed** traffic is permitted. This state is
per-direction:

* If any rule selects an :ref:`endpoint` and the rule has an ingress
  section, the endpoint goes into default deny-mode for ingress.
* If any rule selects an :ref:`endpoint` and the rule has an egress section, the
  endpoint goes into default-deny mode for egress.

This means that endpoints start without any restrictions, and the first
policy will switch the endpoint's default enforcement mode (per direction).

It is possible to create policies that do not enable the default-deny mode for selected
endpoints. The field ``EnableDefaultDeny`` configures this. Rules with ``EnableDefaultDeny``
disabled are ignored when determining the default mode.

For example, this policy causes all DNS traffic to be intercepted, but does not
block any traffic, even if it is the first policy to apply to an endpoint. An
administrator can safely apply this policy cluster-wide, without the risk that
it transitions an endpoint in to default-deny and causes legitimate traffic to be dropped.

.. _policy_rule:

Rule Basics
===========

All policy rules are based upon a whitelist model, that is, each rule in the
policy allows traffic that matches the rule. If two rules exist, and one
would match a broader set of traffic, then all traffic matching the broader
rule will be allowed. If there is an intersection between two or more rules,
then traffic matching the union of those rules will be allowed. Finally, if
traffic does not match any of the rules, it will be dropped pursuant to the
`policy_enforcement_modes`.

Policy rules share a common base type which specifies which endpoints the
rule applies to and common metadata to identify the rule. Each rule is split
into an ingress section and an egress section. The ingress section contains
the rules which must be applied to traffic entering the endpoint, and the
egress section contains rules applied to traffic coming from the endpoint
matching the endpoint selector. Either ingress, egress, or both can be
provided. If both ingress and egress are omitted, the rule has no effect.

----

endpointSelector / nodeSelector
  Selects the endpoints or nodes which the policy rules apply to. The policy
  rules will be applied to all endpoints which match the labels specified in
  the selector. For additional details, see the :ref:`EndpointSelector` and
  :ref:`NodeSelector` sections.

ingress
  List of rules which must apply at ingress of the endpoint, i.e. to all
  network packets which are entering the endpoint.

egress
  List of rules which must apply at egress of the endpoint, i.e. to all network
  packets which are leaving the endpoint.

labels
  Labels are used to identify the rule. Rules can be listed and deleted by
  labels. Policy rules which are imported via :ref:`kubernetes<k8s_policy>`
  automatically get the label ``io.cilium.k8s.policy.name=NAME`` assigned where
  ``NAME`` corresponds to the name specified in the `NetworkPolicy` or
  `CiliumNetworkPolicy` resource.

description
  Description is a string which is not interpreted by Cilium. It can be used to
  describe the intent and scope of the rule in a human readable form.

.. _EndpointSelector:

Endpoint Selector
-----------------

The Endpoint Selector is based on the `Kubernetes LabelSelector`_. It is called
Endpoint Selector because it only applies to labels associated with an
:ref:`Endpoint <endpoint>`.

.. _NodeSelector:

Node Selector
-------------

Like the :ref:`Endpoint Selector <EndpointSelector>`, the Node Selector is
based on the `Kubernetes LabelSelector`_, although rather than
matching on labels associated with Endpoints, it applies to labels associated
with :ref:`Nodes <node>` in the cluster.

Node Selectors can only be used in :ref:`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies
<CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy>`. For details on the scope of node-level
policies, see :ref:`HostPolicies`.
