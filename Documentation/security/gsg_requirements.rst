If you haven't read the :ref:`intro` yet, we'd encourage you to do that first.

The best way to get help if you get stuck is to ask a question on the `Cilium
Slack channel <https://cilium.herokuapp.com>`_.  With Cilium contributors
across the globe, there is almost always someone available to help.

Setup Cilium
============

If you have not set up Cilium yet, follow the guide :ref:`k8s_install_standard`
for instructions on how to quickly bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster and install
Cilium. If in doubt, pick the minikube route, you will be good to go in less
than 5 minutes.
