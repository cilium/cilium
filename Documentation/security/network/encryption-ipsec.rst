****************************
IPsec Transparent Encryption
****************************

This guide explains how to configure Cilium to use IPsec based transparent
encryption using Kubernetes secrets to distribute the IPsec keys. After this
configuration is complete all traffic between Cilium-managed endpoints, as well
as Cilium-managed host traffic, will be encrypted using IPsec. This guide uses
Kubernetes secrets to distribute keys. Alternatively, keys may be manually
distributed, but that is not shown here.

Packets are not encrypted when they are destined to the same node from which
they were sent. This behavior is intended. Encryption would provide no benefits
in that case, given that the raw traffic can be observed on the node anyway.

Generate & Import the PSK
=========================

First, create a Kubernetes secret for the IPsec configuration to be stored. The
example below demonstrates generation of the necessary IPsec configuration
which will be distributed as a Kubernetes secret called ``cilium-ipsec-keys``.
A Kubernetes secret should consist of one key-value pair where the key is the
name of the file to be mounted as a volume in cilium-agent pods, and the
value is an IPSec configuration in the following format::

    key-id encryption-algorithms PSK-in-hex-format key-size

.. note::

    ``Secret`` resources need to be deployed in the same namespace as Cilium!
    In our example, we use ``kube-system``.

In the example below, GCM-128-AES is used. However, any of the algorithms
supported by Linux may be used. To generate the secret, you may use the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ kubectl create -n kube-system secret generic cilium-ipsec-keys \
        --from-literal=keys="3 rfc4106(gcm(aes)) $(echo $(dd if=/dev/urandom count=20 bs=1 2> /dev/null | xxd -p -c 64)) 128"

The secret can be seen with ``kubectl -n kube-system get secrets`` and will be
listed as ``cilium-ipsec-keys``.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ kubectl -n kube-system get secrets cilium-ipsec-keys
    NAME                TYPE     DATA   AGE
    cilium-ipsec-keys   Opaque   1      176m

Enable Encryption in Cilium
===========================

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Cilium CLI

       If you are deploying Cilium with the Cilium CLI, pass the following
       options:

       .. code-block:: shell-session

          cilium install \
             --set encryption.enabled=true \
             --set encryption.type=ipsec

    .. group-tab:: Helm

       If you are deploying Cilium with Helm by following
       :ref:`k8s_install_helm`, pass the following options:

       .. parsed-literal::

           helm install cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
             --namespace kube-system \\
             --set encryption.enabled=true \\
             --set encryption.type=ipsec

       ``encryption.enabled`` enables encryption of the traffic between
       Cilium-managed pods. ``encryption.type`` specifies the encryption method
       and can be omitted as it defaults to ``ipsec``.

.. attention::

   When using Cilium in any direct routing configuration, ensure that the
   native routing CIDR is set properly. This is done using
   ``--ipv4-native-routing-cidr=CIDR`` with the CLI or ``--set
   ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR=CIDR`` with Helm.

At this point the Cilium managed nodes will be using IPsec for all traffic. For further
information on Cilium's transparent encryption, see :ref:`ebpf_datapath`.

Encryption interface
--------------------

An additional argument can be used to identify the network-facing interface.
If direct routing is used and no interface is specified, the default route
link is chosen by inspecting the routing tables. This will work in many cases,
but depending on routing rules, users may need to specify the encryption
interface as follows:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Cilium CLI

       .. code-block:: shell-session

          cilium install \
             --set encryption.enabled=true \
             --set encryption.type=ipsec \
             --set encryption.ipsec.interface=ethX

    .. group-tab:: Helm

       .. code-block:: shell-session

           --set encryption.ipsec.interface=ethX

Validate the Setup
==================

Run a ``bash`` shell in one of the Cilium pods with
``kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti ds/cilium -- bash`` and execute the following
commands:

1. Install tcpdump

   .. code-block:: shell-session

       $ apt-get update
       $ apt-get -y install tcpdump

2. Check that traffic is encrypted. In the example below, this can be verified
   by the fact that packets carry the IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
   In the example below, ``eth0`` is the interface used for pod-to-pod
   communication. Replace this interface with e.g. ``cilium_vxlan`` if
   tunneling is enabled.

   .. code-block:: shell-session

       tcpdump -l -n -i eth0 esp
       tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
       listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
       15:16:21.626416 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e2), length 180
       15:16:21.626473 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e3), length 180
       15:16:21.627167 IP 10.60.0.1 > 10.60.1.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x579d), length 100
       15:16:21.627296 IP 10.60.0.1 > 10.60.1.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x579e), length 100
       15:16:21.627523 IP 10.60.0.1 > 10.60.1.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x579f), length 180
       15:16:21.627699 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e4), length 100
       15:16:21.628408 IP 10.60.1.1 > 10.60.0.1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x57e5), length 100

Key Rotation
============

To replace cilium-ipsec-keys secret with a new key:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    KEYID=$(kubectl get secret -n kube-system cilium-ipsec-keys -o yaml | awk '/^\s*keys:/ {print $2}' | base64 -d | awk '{print $1}')
    if [[ $KEYID -ge 15 ]]; then KEYID=0; fi
    data=$(echo "{\"stringData\":{\"keys\":\"$((($KEYID+1))) "rfc4106\(gcm\(aes\)\)" $(echo $(dd if=/dev/urandom count=20 bs=1 2> /dev/null| xxd -p -c 64)) 128\"}}")
    kubectl patch secret -n kube-system cilium-ipsec-keys -p="${data}" -v=1

During transition the new and old keys will be in use. The Cilium agent keeps
per endpoint data on which key is used by each endpoint and will use the correct
key if either side has not yet been updated. In this way encryption will work as
new keys are rolled out.

The ``KEYID`` environment variable in the above example stores the current key
ID used by Cilium. The key variable is a uint8 with value between 1 and 15
included and should be monotonically increasing every re-key with a rollover
from 15 to 1. The Cilium agent will default to ``KEYID`` of zero if its not
specified in the secret.

Troubleshooting
===============

 * If the ``cilium`` Pods fail to start after enabling encryption, double-check if
   the IPSec ``Secret`` and Cilium are deployed in the same namespace together.

 * Check for ``level=warning`` and ``level=error`` messages in the Cilium log files

   * If there is a warning message similar to ``Device eth0 does not exist``,
     use ``--set encryption.ipsec.interface=ethX`` to set the encryption
     interface.

 * Run ``cilium encrypt status`` in the Cilium Pod:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

       $ cilium encrypt status
       Encryption: IPsec
       Keys in use: 1
       Max Seq. Number: 0x1e3/0xffffffff
       Errors: 0

   If the error counter is non-zero, additional information will be displayed
   with the specific errors the kernel encountered. If the sequence number
   reaches its maximum value, it will also result in errors. The number of
   keys in use should be 2 during a key rotation and always 1 otherwise.

Disabling Encryption
====================

To disable the encryption, regenerate the YAML with the option
``encryption.enabled=false``

Limitations
===========

    * Transparent encryption is not currently supported when chaining Cilium on
      top of other CNI plugins. For more information, see :gh-issue:`15596`.
    * :ref:`HostPolicies` are not currently supported with IPsec encryption.
    * IPsec encryption is not currently supported in combination with IPv6-only clusters.
    * IPsec encryption is not supported on clusters with more than 65535 nodes.
