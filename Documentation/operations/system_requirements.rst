Flatcar
~~~~~~~

Flatcar is known to manipulate network interfaces created and managed by
Cilium. This is especially true in the official Flatcar image for AWS EKS, and
causes connectivity issues and potentially prevents the Cilium agent from
booting when Cilium is running in ENI mode. To avoid this, disable DHCP on
these interfaces and mark them as unmanaged by adding

.. code-block:: text

        [Match]
        Name=eth[1-9]*

        [Network]
        DHCP=no

        [Link]
        Unmanaged=yes

to ``/etc/systemd/network/01-no-dhcp.network`` and then

.. code-block:: shell-session

        systemctl daemon-reload
        systemctl restart systemd-networkd

Ubuntu 22.04 on Raspberry Pi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running Cilium on Ubuntu 22.04 on a Raspberry Pi, please make sure to install the following package:

.. code-block:: shell-session

        sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-raspi

.. _admin_kernel_version:

Linux Kernel
============

Base Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cilium leverages and builds on the kernel eBPF functionality as well as various
subsystems which integrate with eBPF. Therefore, host systems are required to
run a recent Linux kernel to run a Cilium agent. More recent kernels may
provide additional eBPF functionality that Cilium will automatically detect and
use on agent start. For this version of Cilium, it is recommended to use kernel
4.19.57 or later (or equivalent such as 4.18 on RHEL8). For a list of features
that require newer kernels, see :ref:`advanced_features`.

In order for the eBPF feature to be enabled properly, the following kernel
configuration options must be enabled. This is typically the case with
distribution kernels. When an option can be built as a module or statically
linked, either choice is valid.

::

        CONFIG_BPF=y
        CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y
        CONFIG_NET_CLS_BPF=y
        CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y
        CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT=y
        CONFIG_NET_SCH_INGRESS=y
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA1=y
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH=y
        CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
        CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y
        CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y
        CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y


Requirements for Iptables-based Masquerading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not using BPF for masquerading (``enable-bpf-masquerade=false``, the
default value), then you will need the following kernel configuration options.

::

        CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_SET=m
        CONFIG_IP_SET=m
        CONFIG_IP_SET_HASH_IP=m

Requirements for L7 and FQDN Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

L7 proxy redirection currently uses ``TPROXY`` iptables actions as well
as ``socket`` matches. For L7 redirection to work as intended kernel
configuration must include the following modules:

::

        CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_TPROXY=m
        CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CT=m
        CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_MARK=m
        CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_SOCKET=m

When ``xt_socket`` kernel module is missing the forwarding of
redirected L7 traffic does not work in non-tunneled datapath
modes. Since some notable kernels (e.g., COS) are shipping without
``xt_socket`` module, Cilium implements a fallback compatibility mode
to allow L7 policies and visibility to be used with those
kernels. Currently this fallback disables ``ip_early_demux`` kernel
feature in non-tunneled datapath modes, which may decrease system
networking performance. This guarantees HTTP and Kafka redirection
works as intended.  However, if HTTP or Kafka enforcement policies or
visibility annotations are never used, this behavior can be turned off
by adding the following to the helm configuration command line:

.. parsed-literal::

   helm install cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
     ...
     --set enableXTSocketFallback=false

.. _features_kernel_matrix:

Requirements for IPsec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`encryption_ipsec` feature requires a lot of kernel configuration
options, most of which to enable the actual encryption. Note that the
specific options required depend on the algorithm. The list below
corresponds to requirements for GCM-128-AES.

::

        CONFIG_XFRM=y
        CONFIG_XFRM_OFFLOAD=y
        CONFIG_XFRM_STATISTICS=y
        CONFIG_XFRM_ALGO=m
        CONFIG_XFRM_USER=m
        CONFIG_INET{,6}_ESP=m
        CONFIG_INET{,6}_IPCOMP=m
        CONFIG_INET{,6}_XFRM_TUNNEL=m
        CONFIG_INET{,6}_TUNNEL=m
        CONFIG_INET_XFRM_MODE_TUNNEL=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_AEAD=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_AEAD2=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_GCM=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_SEQIV=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_CBC=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=m
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES=m

Requirements for the Bandwidth Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`bandwidth-manager` requires the following kernel configuration option
to change the packet scheduling algorithm.

::

        CONFIG_NET_SCH_FQ=m

.. _advanced_features:

Required Kernel Versions for Advanced Features
==============================================

Additional kernel features continues to progress in the Linux community. Some
of Cilium's features are dependent on newer kernel versions and are thus
enabled by upgrading to more recent kernel versions as detailed below.

====================================================== ===============================
Cilium Feature                                         Minimum Kernel Version

IPv4 BIG TCP support                                   >= 6.3
====================================================== ===============================

.. _req_kvstore:

Key-Value store
===============

Cilium optionally uses a distributed Key-Value store to manage,
synchronize and distribute security identities across all cluster
nodes. The following Key-Value stores are currently supported:

- etcd >= 3.1.0

Cilium can be used without a Key-Value store when CRD-based state
management is used with Kubernetes. This is the default for new Cilium
installations. Larger clusters will perform better with a Key-Value
store backed identity management instead, see :ref:`k8s_quick_install`
for more details.

See :ref:`install_kvstore` for details on how to configure the
``cilium-agent`` to use a Key-Value store.

clang+LLVM
==========


.. note:: This requirement is only needed if you run ``cilium-agent`` natively.
          If you are using the Cilium container image ``cilium/cilium``,
          clang+LLVM is included in the container image.

LLVM is the compiler suite that Cilium uses to generate eBPF bytecode programs
to be loaded into the Linux kernel. The minimum supported version of LLVM
available to ``cilium-agent`` should be >=5.0. The version of clang installed
must be compiled with the eBPF backend enabled.

See https://releases.llvm.org/ for information on how to download and install
LLVM.

.. _firewall_requirements:

Firewall Rules
==============

If you are running Cilium in an environment that requires firewall rules to
enable connectivity, you will have to add the following rules to ensure Cilium
works properly.

It is recommended but optional that all nodes running Cilium in a given cluster
must be able to ping each other so ``cilium-health`` can report and monitor
connectivity among nodes. This requires ICMP Type 0/8, Code 0 open among all
nodes. TCP 4240 should also be open among all nodes for ``cilium-health``
monitoring. Note that it is also an option to only use one of these two methods
to enable health monitoring. If the firewall does not permit either of these
methods, Cilium will still operate fine but will not be able to provide health
information.

For IPSec enabled Cilium deployments, you need to ensure that the firewall
allows ESP traffic through. For example, AWS Security Groups doesn't allow ESP
traffic by default.

If you are using WireGuard, you must allow UDP port 51871. Furthermore, if you
have disabled node-to-node encryption and configured an overlay network mode
(such as VXLAN or Geneve) in addition to WireGuard, then the overlay ports must
also be allowed.

If you are using VXLAN overlay network mode, Cilium uses Linux's default VXLAN
port 8472 over UDP, unless Linux has been configured otherwise. In this case,
UDP 8472 must be open among all nodes to enable VXLAN overlay mode. The same
applies to Geneve overlay network mode, except the port is UDP 6081.

If you are running in direct routing mode, your network must allow routing of
pod IPs.

As an example, if you are running on AWS with VXLAN overlay networking, here is
a minimum set of AWS Security Group (SG) rules. It assumes a separation between
the SG on the master nodes, ``master-sg``, and the worker nodes, ``worker-sg``.
It also assumes ``etcd`` is running on the master nodes.

Master Nodes (``master-sg``) Rules:

======================== =============== ==================== ===============

.. note:: If you use a shared SG for the masters and workers, you can condense
          these rules into ingress/egress to self. If you are using Direct
          Routing mode, you can condense all rules into ingress/egress ANY
          port/protocol to/from self.

The following ports should also be available on each node:

.. _admin_mount_bpffs:

Mounted eBPF filesystem
=======================

.. Note::

        Some distributions mount the bpf filesystem automatically. Check if the
        bpf filesystem is mounted by running the command.

        .. code-block:: shell-session

            # mount | grep /sys/fs/bpf
            $ # if present should output, e.g. "none on /sys/fs/bpf type bpf"...

If the eBPF filesystem is not mounted in the host filesystem, Cilium will
automatically mount the filesystem.

Mounting this BPF filesystem allows the ``cilium-agent`` to persist eBPF
resources across restarts of the agent so that the datapath can continue to
operate while the agent is subsequently restarted or upgraded.

Optionally it is also possible to mount the eBPF filesystem before Cilium is
deployed in the cluster, the following command must be run in the host mount
namespace. The command must only be run once during the boot process of the
machine.

   .. code-block:: shell-session

	# mount bpffs /sys/fs/bpf -t bpf

A portable way to achieve this with persistence is to add the following line to
``/etc/fstab`` and then run ``mount /sys/fs/bpf``. This will cause the
filesystem to be automatically mounted when the node boots.

::

     bpffs			/sys/fs/bpf		bpf	defaults 0 0

If you are using systemd to manage the kubelet, see the section
:ref:`bpffs_systemd`.

Routing Tables
==============

When running in :ref:`ipam_eni` IPAM mode, Cilium will install per-ENI routing
tables for each ENI that is used by Cilium for pod IP allocation.
These routing tables are added to the host network namespace and must not be
otherwise used by the system.
The index of those per-ENI routing tables is computed as
``10 + <eni-interface-index>``. The base offset of 10 is chosen as it is highly
unlikely to collide with the main routing table which is between 253-255.

Privileges
==========

The following privileges are required to run Cilium. When running the standard
Kubernetes :term:`DaemonSet`, the privileges are automatically granted to Cilium.

* Cilium interacts with the Linux kernel to install eBPF program which will then
  perform networking tasks and implement security rules. In order to install
  eBPF programs system-wide, ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` privileges are required. These
  privileges must be granted to ``cilium-agent``.

  The quickest way to meet the requirement is to run ``cilium-agent`` as root
  and/or as privileged container.

* Cilium requires access to the host networking namespace. For this purpose,
  the Cilium pod is scheduled to run in the host networking namespace directly.
