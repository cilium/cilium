*********************************
Limiting Identity-Relevant Labels
*********************************

We recommend that operators with larger environments limit the set of
identity-relevant labels to avoid frequent creation of new security identities.
Many Kubernetes labels are not useful for policy enforcement or visibility. A
few good examples of such labels include timestamps or hashes. These labels,
when included in evaluation, cause Cilium to generate a unique identity for each
pod instead of a single identity for all of the pods that comprise a service or
application.

By default, Cilium considers all labels to be relevant for identities, with the
following exceptions:

================================== ==============================================
Label                               Description
---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
``any:!io.kubernetes``             Ignore all ``io.kubernetes`` labels
``any:!kubernetes.io``             Ignore all other ``kubernetes.io`` labels
``any:!beta.kubernetes.io``        Ignore all ``beta.kubernetes.io`` labels
``any:!k8s.io``                    Ignore all ``k8s.io`` labels
``any:!pod-template-generation``   Ignore all ``pod-template-generation`` labels
``any:!pod-template-hash``         Ignore all ``pod-template-hash`` labels
``any:!controller-revision-hash``  Ignore all ``controller-revision-hash`` labels
``any:!annotation.*``              Ignore all ``annotation labels``
``any:!etcd_node``                 Ignore all ``etcd_node`` labels
================================== ==============================================

The above label examples are all *exclusive labels*, that is to say they define
which label keys should be ignored. These are identified by the presence of the
``!`` character.

Label configurations that do not contain the ``!`` character are *inclusive
labels*. Once at least one inclusive label is added, only labels that match the
inclusive label configuration may be considered relevant for identities.
Additionally, when at least one inclusive label is configured, the following
inclusive labels are automatically added to the configuration:

====================================== =====================================================
Label                                  Description
-------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
``reserved:.*``                        Include all ``reserved`` labels
``any:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace``    Include all ``io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`` labels
``any:io.cilium.k8s.namespace.labels`` Include all ``io.cilium.k8s.namespace.labels`` labels
``any:app.kubernetes.io``              Include all ``app.kubernetes.io`` labels
====================================== =====================================================



Configuring Identity-Relevant Labels
------------------------------------

To limit the labels used for evaluating Cilium identities, edit the Cilium
ConfigMap object using ``kubectl edit cm -n kube-system cilium-config``
and insert a line to define the labels to include or exclude. Alternatively,
this attribute can also be set via helm option ``--set labels=<values>``.


.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
    ...
      kube-proxy-replacement: partial
      labels:  "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace k8s:k8s-app k8s:app k8s:name"
      enable-ipv4-masquerade: "true"
      monitor-aggregation: medium
    ...


Upon defining a custom list of labels in the ConfigMap, Cilium add the provided
list of labels to the default list of labels. After saving the ConfigMap,
restart the Cilium Agents to pickup the new labels setting.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    kubectl delete pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=cilium

Existing identities will not change as a result of this new configuration. To
apply the new label setting to existing identities, restart the associated pods.
Upon restart, new identities will be created. The old identities will be garbage
collected by the Cilium Operator once they are no longer used by any Cilium
endpoints.

When specifying multiple labels to evaluate, provide the list of labels as a
space-separated string.

Including Labels
----------------

Labels can be defined as a list of labels to include. Only the labels specified
and the default inclusive labels will be used to evaluate Cilium identities:

.. code-block:: yaml

    labels: "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace k8s:k8s-app k8s:app k8s:name"

The above configuration would only include the following label keys when
evaluating Cilium identities:

- k8s:k8s-app
- k8s:app
- k8s:name
- reserved:.*
- io.kubernetes.pod.namespace
- io.cilium.k8s.namespace.labels
- app.kubernetes.io

Note that ``k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`` is already included in default
label ``io.kubernetes.pod.namespace``.

Labels with the same prefix as defined in the configuration will also be
considered. This lists some examples of label keys that would also be evaluated
for Cilium identities:

- k8s-app-team
- app-production
- name-defined

When a single inclusive label is added to the filter, all labels not defined
in the default list will be excluded. For example, pods running with the
security labels ``team=team-1, env=prod`` will have the label ``env=prod``
ignored as soon Cilium is started with the filter ``k8s:team``.

Excluding Labels
----------------

Labels can also be specified as a list of exclusions. Exclude a label by placing
an exclamation mark after colon separating the prefix and label. When defined as a
list of exclusions, Cilium will include the set of default labels, but will
exclude any matches in the provided list when evaluating Cilium identities:

.. code-block:: yaml

    labels: "k8s:!controller-uid k8s:!job-name"

The provided example would cause Cilium to exclude any of the following label
matches:

- k8s:controller-uid
- k8s:job-name
