## cilium bpf srv6 list

List SRv6 policy entries

### Synopsis

List SRv6 policy entries.

Note that for Linux kernel versions between 4.11 and 4.15 inclusive, the native
LPM map type used for implementing this feature does not provide the ability to
walk / dump the entries, so on these kernel versions this tool will never
return any entries, even if entries exist in the map. 

```
cilium bpf srv6 list [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help            help for list
  -o, --output string   json| jsonpath='{}'
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.cilium.yaml)
  -D, --debug           Enable debug messages
  -H, --host string     URI to server-side API
```
