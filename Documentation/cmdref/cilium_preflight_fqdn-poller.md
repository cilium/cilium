## cilium preflight fqdn-poller

Prepare for DNS Polling upgrades to cilium 1.4

### Synopsis

Prepare for DNS Polling upgrades to cilium 1.4 by creating a
placeholder --tofqdns-pre-cache file that can be used to pre-seed the DNS
cached used in toFQDNs rules. This is useful when upgrading cilium with
DNS Polling policies where an interruption in allowed IPs is undesirable. It
may also be used when switching from DNS Polling based DNS discovery to DNS
Proxy based discovery where an endpoint may not make a DNS request soon
enough to be used by toFQDNs policy rules
