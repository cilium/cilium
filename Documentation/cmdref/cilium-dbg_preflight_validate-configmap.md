## cilium-dbg preflight validate-configmap

Validate Cilium ConfigMap for unrecognized keys in the daemon and operator.

### Synopsis

Before upgrading Cilium, it is recommended to run this validation checker to 
ensure that the deployed Cilium ConfigMap is valid. The validator verifies that all configuration
keys are recognized by both the daemon and the operator. If any unrecognized keys are found, an
error is printed and the command exits with a non-zero status code.
