Roadmap
=======

The Cilium project is community driven, thus the work that gets done and the
project's future roadmap is determined by what work individuals decide to do.

You are welcome to raise feature requests by creating them as `GitHub issues`_.
Please search the existing issues to avoid raising duplicates, if you find that
someone else is making the same or similar request we encourage the use of
GitHub emojis to express your support for an idea! 

The most active way to influence the capabilities in Cilium is to get involved
in development. We label issues with `good-first-issue`_ to help new potential
contributors find issues and feature requests that are relatively self-contained
and could be a good place to start. Please also read the :ref:`dev_guide` for
details of our pull request process and expectations, along with instructions
for setting up your development environment.

We encourage you to discuss your ideas for significant enhancements and feature
requests on the ``#development`` channel on `Cilium Slack`_, bring them to the
:ref:`community-meeting`, and/or create a `CFP design doc`_.

The project does not give date commitments since the work is dependent on the
community. If you're looking for commitments to apply engineering resources to
work on particular features, one option is to discuss this with the companies
who offer `commercial distributions of Cilium <enterprise_>`_ and may be able to
help.

Release Cadence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We aim to make 2 to 3 `point releases`_ per year of Cilium and its core components
(Hubble, Cilium CLI, Tetragon, etc.). We also make patch releases available as
necessary for security or urgent fixes. 

Focus Areas
-----------

For a finer-granularity view, and insight into detailed enhancements and fixes,
please refer to `issues on GitHub <GitHub issues_>`_. The Cilium committers_ are the
main drivers of where the project is heading.

Welcoming New Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a CNCF project we want to make it easier for new contributors to get involved
with Cilium. This includes both code and non-code contributions such as
documentation, blog posts, example configurations, presentations, training
courses, testing and more. Check the :ref:`dev_guide` documentation to understand how to get
involved with code contributions, and the `Get Involved`_ guide for guidance on
contributing blog posts, training and other resources.
