Weekly Community Meeting
========================

The Cilium contributors gather every Wednesday at 8am PDT, 17:00 CEST, for a
Zoom call open to everyone. During that time, we discuss:

- Status of the next releases for each supported Cilium release
- Current state of our CI: flakes being investigated and upcoming changes
- Development items for the next release
- Any other community-relevant topics during the open session

If you want to discuss something during the next meeting's open session,
you can add it to `the meeting's Google doc
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_4chDk4rznD6UgXPlPvn3Dc7l-ZutGajUv1eF0VDwQ/edit#>`_.
The Zoom link to the meeting is available in the ``#development`` Slack
channel and in `the meeting notes
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_4chDk4rznD6UgXPlPvn3Dc7l-ZutGajUv1eF0VDwQ/edit#>`_.
