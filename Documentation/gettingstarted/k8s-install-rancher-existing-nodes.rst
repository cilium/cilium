Installation using Rancher
**************************

Pre-Requisites
==============

`Rancher Version 2.x <https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/>`_

Create a New Cluster
====================

In Rancher UI, navigate to the Clusters page. In the top right, click on the
``Add Cluster`` box to create a new cluster.

.. image:: images/rancher_add_cluster.png

On the Add Cluster page select to create a new cluster from ``Existing Nodes``:

.. image:: images/rancher_existing_nodes.png

On the ``Add Cluster`` page that opens, provide a name for the cluster. Next to
the ``Cluster Options`` section click the box to ``Edit as YAML``. The configuration
for the cluster will open up in an editor in the window.

.. image:: images/rancher_edit_as_yaml.png

Remove all configuration pertaining to the default network plugin:

.. image:: images/rancher_delete_network_plugin.png

Ensure that network plugin type ``none`` is specified:

.. image:: images/rancher_network_plugin_none.png

Make any additional changes to the configuration that are appropriate for your
environment. When you are ready, click ``Create`` and Rancher will create the
cluster in the ``Provisioning`` state.

Rancher will also present you with instructions on how to add nodes to the
cluster:

.. image:: images/rancher_add_nodes.png

Before adding nodes to the cluster, ensure the BPF filesystem is mounted.
You can persist the configuration using the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo mount bpffs -t bpf /sys/fs/bpf
  sudo bash -c "echo 'none /sys/fs/bpf bpf rw,relatime 0 0' >> /etc/fstab"


Next, add nodes to the cluster using the Rancher-provided Docker commands. Be
sure to add the appropriate number of nodes required for your cluster. After
a few minutes, you will see that the Nodes overview will show an error message
in the Rancher UI:

.. image:: images/rancher_node_not_ready.png

This error is expected. The Kubernetes components are not able to fully
communicate with each other because a CNI plugin has not been installed yet.

In the Rancher UI, navigate to ``Tools`` -> ``Catalogs`` and click the ``Add
Catalog`` button:

.. image:: images/rancher_add_catalog.png

In the window that opens, add the official Cilium Helm v3 chart repository to
the Rancher catalog:

.. image:: images/rancher_add_cilium_catalog.png

Once added, you should see the Cilium repository in the catalog list:

.. image:: images/rancher_catalog_list_success.png

Navigate to the Global Apps list and click the button to ``Launch`` an application:

.. image:: images/rancher_apps_click_launch.png

Provide a name for the application and select the System project in your cluster
as the application target:

.. image:: images/rancher_app_target_project.png

Be sure to configure the application to have cluster-wide scope:

.. image:: images/rancher_cluster_scope.png

Configure any additional values for the Cilium chart and click ``Next``. The
application should deploy within the target cluster and project.

After a few minutes, you should see all nodes as active, and proper deployments
of all Cilium objects.
