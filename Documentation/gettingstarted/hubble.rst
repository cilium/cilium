Service Map & Hubble UI
***********************

This tutorial guides you through enabling the Hubble UI to access the graphical
service map.

.. image:: images/hubble_sw_service_map.png

.. note::

   This guide assumes that Cilium and Hubble have been correctly installed in your
   Kubernetes cluster. Please see :ref:`k8s_quick_install` and :ref:`hubble_setup`
   for more information. If unsure, run ``cilium status`` and validate that Cilium
   and Hubble are installed.

Enable the Hubble UI
====================

Enable the Hubble UI by running the following command:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Cilium CLI 

        If Hubble is already enabled with ``cilium hubble enable``, you must first temporarily disable Hubble with ``cilium hubble disable``.
        This is because the Hubble UI cannot be added at runtime.

        .. code-block:: shell-session

            cilium hubble enable --ui
            üîë Found existing CA in secret cilium-ca
            ‚ú® Patching ConfigMap cilium-config to enable Hubble...
            ‚ôªÔ∏è  Restarted Cilium pods
            ‚úÖ Relay is already deployed
            ‚úÖ Hubble UI is already deployed

    .. group-tab:: Helm

        .. parsed-literal::

           helm upgrade cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
              --namespace $CILIUM_NAMESPACE \\
              --reuse-values \\
              --set hubble.relay.enabled=true \\
              --set hubble.ui.enabled=true

    .. group-tab:: Helm (Standalone install)

        Clusters sometimes come with Cilium, Hubble, and Hubble relay already installed.
        When this is the case you can still use Helm to install only Hubble UI on top of the pre-installed components.

        You will need to set ``hubble.ui.standalone.enabled`` to ``true`` and optionally provide a volume to mount
        Hubble UI client certificates if TLS is enabled on Hubble Relay server side.

        Below is an example deploying Hubble UI as standalone, with client certificates mounted from a ``my-hubble-ui-client-certs`` secret:

        .. parsed-literal::

            helm upgrade --install --namespace kube-system cilium |CHART_RELEASE| --values - <<EOF
            agent: false
            operator:
              enabled: false
            cni:
              install: false
            hubble:
              enabled: false
              relay:
                # set this to false as Hubble relay is already installed
                enabled: false
                tls:
                  server:
                    # set this to true if tls is enabled on Hubble relay server side
                    enabled: true
              ui:
                # enable Hubble UI
                enabled: true
                standalone:
                  # enable Hubble UI standalone deployment
                  enabled: true
                  # provide a volume containing Hubble relay client certificates to mount in Hubble UI pod
                  tls:
                    certsVolume:
                      projected:
                        defaultMode: 0400
                        sources:
                          - secret:
                              name: my-hubble-ui-client-certs
                              items:
                                - key: tls.crt
                                  path: client.crt
                                - key: tls.key
                                  path: client.key
                                - key: ca.crt
                                  path: hubble-relay-ca.crt
            EOF

        Please note that Hubble UI expects the certificate files to be available under the following paths:

        .. code-block:: shell-session

            - name: TLS_RELAY_CA_CERT_FILES
              value: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs/hubble-relay-ca.crt
            - name: TLS_RELAY_CLIENT_CERT_FILE
              value: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs/client.crt
            - name: TLS_RELAY_CLIENT_KEY_FILE
              value: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs/client.key

        Keep this in mind when providing the volume containing the certificate.


Open the Hubble UI
==================

Open the Hubble UI in your browser by running ``cilium hubble ui``. It will
automatically set up a port forward to the hubble-ui service in your Kubernetes
cluster and make it available on a local port on your machine.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    cilium hubble ui
    Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:12000 -> 8081
    Forwarding from [::]:12000 -> 8081

.. tip::

   The above command will block and continue running while the port forward is
   active. You can interrupt the command to abort the port forward and re-run
   the command to make the UI accessible again.

If your browser has not automatically opened the UI, open the page
http://localhost:12000 in your browser. You should see a screen with an
invitation to select a namespace, use the namespace selector dropdown on the
left top corner to select a namespace:

.. image:: images/hubble_service_map_namespace_selector.png

In this example, we are deploying the Star Wars demo from the :ref:`gs_http`
guide. However you can apply the same techniques to observe application
connectivity dependencies in your own namespace, and clusters for
application of any type.

Once the deployment is ready, issue a request from both spaceships to emulate
some traffic.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ kubectl exec xwing -- curl -s -XPOST deathstar.default.svc.cluster.local/v1/request-landing
    Ship landed
    $ kubectl exec tiefighter -- curl -s -XPOST deathstar.default.svc.cluster.local/v1/request-landing
    Ship landed

These requests will then be displayed in the UI as service dependencies between
the different pods:

.. image:: images/hubble_sw_service_map.png

In the bottom of the interface, you may also inspect each recent Hubble flow
event in your current namespace individually.

Inspecting a wide variety of network traffic
============================================

In order to generate some network traffic, run the connectivity test in a loop:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   while true; do cilium connectivity test; done 

To see the traffic in Hubble, open http://localhost:12000/cilium-test in your
browser.
