Restart unmanaged Pods
======================

If you did not use the ``nodeinit.restartPods=true`` in the Helm options when
deploying Cilium, then unmanaged pods need to be restarted manually.  Restart
all already running pods which are not running in host-networking mode to
ensure that Cilium starts managing them. This is required to ensure that all
pods which have been running before Cilium was deployed have network
connectivity provided by Cilium and NetworkPolicy applies to them:

::

    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,HOSTNETWORK:.spec.hostNetwork --no-headers=true | grep '<none>' | awk '{print "-n "$1" "$2}' | xargs -L 1 -r kubectl delete pod
    pod "event-exporter-v0.2.3-f9c896d75-cbvcz" deleted
    pod "fluentd-gcp-scaler-69d79984cb-nfwwk" deleted
    pod "heapster-v1.6.0-beta.1-56d5d5d87f-qw8pv" deleted
    pod "kube-dns-5f8689dbc9-2nzft" deleted
    pod "kube-dns-5f8689dbc9-j7x5f" deleted
    pod "kube-dns-autoscaler-76fcd5f658-22r72" deleted
    pod "kube-state-metrics-7d9774bbd5-n6m5k" deleted
    pod "l7-default-backend-6f8697844f-d2rq2" deleted
    pod "metrics-server-v0.3.1-54699c9cc8-7l5w2" deleted

.. note::

    This may error out on macOS due to ``-r`` being unsupported by
    ``xargs``. In this case you can safely run this command without ``-r``
    with the symptom that this will hang if there are no pods to
    restart. You can stop this with ``ctrl-c``.
