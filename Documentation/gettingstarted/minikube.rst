Getting Started Using Minikube
******************************

This guide uses `minikube <https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/>`_
to demonstrate deployment and operation of Cilium in a single-node Kubernetes cluster.
The minikube VM requires approximately 2 GB of RAM and supports hypervisors like VirtualBox
that run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

If you instead want to understand the details of
deploying Cilium on a full fledged Kubernetes cluster, then go straight to
:ref:`admin_install_daemonset`.
