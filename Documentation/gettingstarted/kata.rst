***************************
Kata Containers with Cilium
***************************

`Kata Containers <https://katacontainers.io/>`_ is an open source project that
provides a secure container runtime with lightweight virtual machines that feel
and perform like containers, but provide stronger workload isolation using
hardware virtualization technology as a second layer of defense.  Kata
Containers implements OCI runtime spec, just like ``runc`` that is used by
Docker. Cilium can be used along with Kata Containers, using both enables
higher degree of security. Kata Containers enhances security in the compute
layer, while Cilium provides policy and observability in the networking layer.

This guide shows how to install Cilium along with Kata Containers. It assumes
that you have already followed the official
`Kata Containers installation user guide <https://github.com/kata-containers/documentation/tree/master/install>`_
to get the Kata Containers runtime up and running on your platform of choice
but that you haven't yet setup Kubernetes.

.. note::
   This guide has been validated by following the Kata Containers guide for
   Google Compute Engine (GCE) and using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with the packaged
   version of Kata Containers, CRI-containerd and Kubernetes 1.18.3.

Setup Kubernetes with CRI
=========================

Kata Containers runtime is an OCI compatible runtime and cannot directly
interact with the CRI API level. For this reason, it relies on a CRI
implementation to translate CRI into OCI. At the time of writing this guide,
there are two supported ways called CRI-O and CRI-containerd. It is up to you
to choose the one that you want, but you have to pick one.

Refer to the section :ref:`k8s_requirements` for detailed instruction on how to
prepare your Kubernetes environment and make sure to use Kubernetes >= 1.12.
Then, follow the
`official guide to run Kata Containers with Kubernetes <https://github.com/kata-containers/documentation/blob/master/how-to/run-kata-with-k8s.md>`_.

.. note::
   Minimum version of kubernetes 1.12 is required to use the RuntimeClass Feature
   for Kata Container runtime described below.

With your Kubernetes cluster ready, you can now proceed to deploy Cilium.

Deploy Cilium
=============

.. include:: k8s-install-download-release.rst

Deploy Cilium release via Helm:

  .. tabs::

     .. group-tab:: Using CRI-O

        .. parsed-literal::

           helm install cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
             --namespace kube-system \\
             --set global.containerRuntime.integration=crio

     .. group-tab:: Using CRI-containerd

        .. parsed-literal::

           helm install cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
             --namespace kube-system \\
             --set global.containerRuntime.integration=containerd

.. include:: k8s-install-validate.rst

Run Kata Containers with Cilium CNI
===================================

Now that your Kubernetes cluster is configured with the Kata Containers runtime
and Cilium as the CNI, you can run a sample workload by following
`these instructions <https://github.com/kata-containers/packaging/tree/master/kata-deploy#run-a-sample-workload>`_.
