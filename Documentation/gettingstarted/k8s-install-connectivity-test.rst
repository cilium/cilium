Deploy the connectivity test
----------------------------

You can deploy the "connectivity-check" to test connectivity between pods.

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/connectivity-check/connectivity-check.yaml

It will deploy a series of deployments which will use various connectivity
paths to connect to each other. Connectivity paths include with and without
service load-balancing and various network policy combinations. The pod name
indicates the connectivity variant and the readiness and liveness gate
indicates success or failure of the test:

.. note::

   Depending on the kernel version you are running on, the HostPort feature may
   not be enabled by default. If so, the two HostPort related pods will remain
   in not-ready state and restart. If you are running on Linux kernel < 4.19,
   and want to use HostPort, follow the instructions in
   :ref:`k8s_install_portmap` to enable it.
