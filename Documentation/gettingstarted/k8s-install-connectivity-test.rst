Deploy the connectivity test
----------------------------

You can deploy the "connectivity-check" to test connectivity between pods. It is
recommended to create a separate namespace for this.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl create ns cilium-test

Deploy the check with:

.. parsed-literal::

   kubectl apply -n cilium-test -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/connectivity-check/connectivity-check.yaml

It will deploy a series of deployments which will use various connectivity
paths to connect to each other. Connectivity paths include with and without
service load-balancing and various network policy combinations. The pod name
indicates the connectivity variant and the readiness and liveness gate
indicates success or failure of the test:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ kubectl get pods -n cilium-test

.. note::

    If you deploy the connectivity check to a single node cluster, pods that check multi-node
    functionalities will remain in the ``Pending`` state. This is expected since these pods
    need at least 2 nodes to be scheduled successfully.
