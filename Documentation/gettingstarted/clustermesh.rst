***********************
Setting up Cluster Mesh
***********************

This is a step-by-step guide on how to build a mesh of Kubernetes clusters by
connecting them together, enabling pod-to-pod connectivity across all clusters,
define global services to load-balance between clusters and enforce security
policies to restrict access.

Prerequisites
#############

* PodCIDR ranges in all clusters must be non-conflicting.

* This guide and the referenced scripts assume that Cilium was installed using
  the :ref:`k8s_install_etcd_operator` instructions which leads to etcd being
  managed by Cilium using etcd-operator. You can use any way to manage etcd but
  you will have to adjust some of the scripts to account for different secret
  names and adjust the LoadBalancer to expose the etcd pods.

* Nodes in all clusters must have IP connectivity between each other. This
  requirement is typically met by establishing peering or VPN tunnels between
  the networks of the nodes of each cluster.

* All nodes must have a unique IP address assigned them. Node IPs of clusters
  being connected together may not conflict with each other.

* Cilium must be configured to use etcd as the kvstore. Consul is not supported
  by cluster mesh at this point.

* It is highly recommended to use a TLS protected etcd cluster with Cilium. The
  server certificate of etcd must whitelist the host name ``*.mesh.cilium.io``.
  If you are using the ``cilium-etcd-operator`` as set up in the
  :ref:`k8s_install_etcd_operator` instructions then this is automatically
  taken care of.

* The network between clusters must allow the inter-cluster communication. The
  exact ports are documented in the :ref:`firewall_requirements` section.


Prepare the clusters
####################

Specify the cluster name and ID
===============================

Each cluster must be assigned a unique human-readable name. The name will be
used to group nodes of a cluster together. The cluster name is specified with
the ``--cluster-name=NAME`` argument or ``cluster-name`` ConfigMap option.

To ensure scalability of identity allocation and policy enforcement, each
cluster continues to manage its own security identity allocation. In order to
guarantee compatibility with identities across clusters, each cluster is
configured with a unique cluster ID configured with the ``--cluster-id=ID``
argument or ``cluster-id`` ConfigMap option. The value must be between 1 and
255.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl -n kube-system edit cm cilium-config
   [ ... add/edit ... ]
   cluster-name: cluster1
   cluster-id: "1"

Repeat this step for each cluster.

Expose the Cilium etcd to other clusters
========================================

The Cilium etcd must be exposed to other clusters. There are many ways to
achieve this. The method documented in this guide will work with cloud
providers that implement the Kubernetes ``LoadBalancer`` service type:

.. tabs::
  .. group-tab:: GCP

    .. parsed-literal::

      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: cilium-etcd-external
        annotations:
          cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
        ports:
        - port: 2379
        selector:
          app: etcd
          etcd_cluster: cilium-etcd
          io.cilium/app: etcd-operator

  .. group-tab:: AWS

    .. parsed-literal::

      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: cilium-etcd-external
        annotations:
          service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: 0.0.0.0/0
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
        ports:
        - port: 2379
        selector:
          app: etcd
          etcd_cluster: cilium-etcd
          io.cilium/app: etcd-operator

The example used here exposes the etcd cluster as managed by
``cilium-etcd-operator`` installed by the standard installation instructions as
an internal service which means that it is only exposed inside of a VPC and not
publicly accessible outside of the VPC. It is recommended to use a static IP
for the ServiceIP to avoid requiring to update the IP mapping as done in one of
the later steps.

If you are running the cilium-etcd-operator you can simply apply the following
service to expose etcd:

.. tabs::
  .. group-tab:: GCP

    .. parsed-literal::

       kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/clustermesh/cilium-etcd-external-service/cilium-etcd-external-gke.yaml

  .. group-tab:: AWS

    .. parsed-literal::

       kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/clustermesh/cilium-etcd-external-service/cilium-etcd-external-eks.yaml


.. note::

   Make sure that you create the service in namespace in which cilium and/or
   etcd is running. Depending on which installation method you chose, this
   could be ``kube-system`` or ``cilium``.

Extract the TLS keys and generate the etcd configuration
========================================================

The cluster mesh control plane performs TLS based authentication and encryption.
For this purpose, the TLS keys and certificates of each etcd need to be made
available to all clusters that wish to connect.

1. Clone the ``cilium/clustermesh-tools`` repository. It contains scripts to
   extracts the secrets and generate a Kubernetes secret in form of a YAML
   file:

   .. code:: bash
   
        git clone https://github.com/cilium/clustermesh-tools.git
        cd clustermesh-tools

2. Ensure that the kubectl context is pointing to the cluster you want to
   extract the secret from.

3. Extract the TLS certificate, key and root CA authority.

   .. code:: bash

        ./extract-etcd-secrets.sh

   This will extract the keys that Cilium is using to connect to the etcd in
   the local cluster. The key files are written to
   ``config/<cluster-name>.*.{key|crt|-ca.crt}``

4. Repeat this step for all clusters you want to connect with each other.

5. Generate a single Kubernetes secret from all the keys and certificates
   extracted. The secret will contain the etcd configuration with the service
   IP or host name of the etcd including the keys and certificates to access
   it.

   .. code:: bash

        ./generate-secret-yaml.sh > clustermesh.yaml

.. note::

   The key files in ``config/`` and the secret represented as YAML are
   sensitive. Anyone gaining access to these files is able to connect to the
   etcd instances in the local cluster. Delete the files after the you are done
   setting up the cluster mesh.

Ensure that the etcd service names can be resolved
==================================================

For TLS authentication to work properly, agents will connect to etcd in remote
clusters using a pre-defined naming schema ``{clustername}.mesh.cilium.io``. In
order for DNS resolution to work on these virtual host name, the names are
statically mapped to the service IP via the ``/etc/hosts`` file.

1. The following script will generate the required segment which has to be
   inserted into the ``cilium`` DaemonSet:

    .. code:: bash

       ./generate-name-mapping.sh > ds.patch

    The ``ds.patch`` will look something like this:

    .. code:: bash

        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              hostAliases:
              - ip: "10.138.0.18"
                hostnames:
                - cluster1.mesh.cilium.io
              - ip: "10.138.0.19"
                hostnames:
                - cluster2.mesh.cilium.io

2. Apply the patch to all DaemonSets in all clusters:

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl -n kube-system patch ds cilium -p "$(cat ds.patch)"

Establish connections between clusters
######################################

1. Import the ``cilium-clustermesh`` secret that you generated in the last
chapter into all of your clusters:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl apply -f clustermesh.yaml

2. Restart the cilium-agent in all clusters so it picks up the new cluster
   name, cluster id and mounts the ``cilium-clustermesh`` secret. Cilium will
   automatically establish connectivity between the clusters.

.. code:: bash

    kubectl -n kube-system delete -l k8s-app=cilium

Test pod connectivity between clusters
======================================


Run ``cilium node list`` to see the full list of nodes discovered. You can run
this command inside any Cilium pod in any cluster:

.. code:: bash

    $ kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti cilium-g6btl cilium node list
    Name                                                   IPv4 Address    Endpoint CIDR   IPv6 Address   Endpoint CIDR
    cluster5/ip-172-0-117-60.us-west-2.compute.internal    172.0.117.60    10.2.2.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a02:200:0:0/112
    cluster5/ip-172-0-186-231.us-west-2.compute.internal   172.0.186.231   10.2.3.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a02:300:0:0/112
    cluster5/ip-172-0-50-227.us-west-2.compute.internal    172.0.50.227    10.2.0.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a02:0:0:0/112
    cluster5/ip-172-0-51-175.us-west-2.compute.internal    172.0.51.175    10.2.1.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a02:100:0:0/112
    cluster7/ip-172-0-121-242.us-west-2.compute.internal   172.0.121.242   10.4.2.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a04:200:0:0/112
    cluster7/ip-172-0-58-194.us-west-2.compute.internal    172.0.58.194    10.4.1.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a04:100:0:0/112
    cluster7/ip-172-0-60-118.us-west-2.compute.internal    172.0.60.118    10.4.0.0/24     <nil>          f00d::a04:0:0:0/112


.. code:: bash

    $ kubectl exec -ti pod-cluster5-xxx curl <pod-ip-cluster7>
    [...]

Load-balancing with Global Services
###################################

Establishing load-balancing between clusters is achieved by defining a
Kubernetes service with identical name and namespace in each cluster and adding
the annotation ``io.cilium/global-service: "true"``` to declare it global.
Cilium will automatically perform load-balancing to pods in both clusters.

.. code:: bash

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: rebel-base
      annotations:
        io.cilium/global-service: "true"
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
      - port: 80
      selector:
        name: rebel-base

Deploying a simple example service
==================================

1. In cluster 1, deploy:

   .. code:: bash

       kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/clustermesh/global-service-example/cluster1.yaml

2. In cluster 2, deploy:

   .. code:: bash

       kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes/clustermesh/global-service-example/cluster2.yaml

3. From either cluster, access the global service:

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl exec -ti xwing-xxx -- curl rebel-base

   You will see replies from pods in both clusters


Security Policies
#################

As addressing and network security is decoupled, network security enforcement
automatically spans across clusters. Note that Kubernetes security policies are
not automatically distributed across clusters, it is your responsibility to
apply ``CiliumNetworkPolicy`` or ``NetworkPolicy`` in all clusters.

Allowing specific communication between clusters
================================================

The following policy illustrates how to allow particular pods to allow
communicate between two clusters. The cluster name refers to the name given via
the ``--cluster-name`` agent option or ``cluster-name`` ConfigMap option.

::

    apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
    kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: "allow-cross-cluster"
      description: "Allow x-wing in cluster1 to contact rebel-base in cluster2"
    spec:
      endpointSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: x-wing
          io.cilium.k8s.policy.cluster: cluster1
      egress:
      - toEndpoints:
        - matchLabels:
            name: rebel-base
            io.cilium.k8s.policy.cluster: cluster2

Limitations
###########

 * L7 security policies currently only work across multiple clusters if worker
   nodes have routes installed allowing to route pod IPs of all clusters. This
   is given when running in direct routing mode by running a routing daemon or
   ``--auto-direct-node-routes`` but won't work automatically when using
   tunnel/encapsulation mode.

 * The number of clusters that can be connected together is currently limited
   to 255. This limitation will be lifted in the future when running in direct
   routing mode or when running in encapsulation mode with encryption enabled.

Roadmap Ahead
#############

 * Future versions will put an API server before etcd to provide better
   scalability and simplify the installation to support any etcd support

 * Introduction of IPSec and use of ESP or utilization of the traffic class
   field in the IPv6 header will allow to use more than 8 bits for the
   cluster-id and thus support more than 256 clusters.
