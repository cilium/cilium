*******************************
Setting up Hubble Observability
*******************************

Hubble is the observability layer of Cilium and can be used to obtain
cluster-wide visibility into the network and security layer of your Kubernetes
cluster. For more information about Hubble and its components, see the
:ref:`concepts_observability` section.

.. note::

   This guide assumes that Cilium has been correctly installed in your
   Kubernetes cluster. Please see :ref:`k8s_quick_install` for more
   information. If unsure, run ``cilium status`` and validate that Cilium is up
   and running.

Enable Hubble in Cilium
=======================

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Cilium CLI

        In order to enable Hubble, run the command ``cilium hubble enable`` as shown
        below:

        .. code-block:: shell-session

            $ cilium hubble enable

        .. tip::

           Enabling Hubble requires the TCP port 4245 to be open on all nodes running
           Cilium. This is required for Relay to operate correctly.

        Run ``cilium status`` to validate that Hubble is enabled and running:

        .. code-block:: shell-session

            $ cilium status
                /¬Ø¬Ø\
             /¬Ø¬Ø\__/¬Ø¬Ø\    Cilium:         OK
             \__/¬Ø¬Ø\__/    Operator:       OK
             /¬Ø¬Ø\__/¬Ø¬Ø\    Hubble:         OK
             \__/¬Ø¬Ø\__/    ClusterMesh:    disabled
                \__/

    .. group-tab:: Helm

        If you installed Cilium via ``helm install``, you may enable Hubble
        Relay and UI with the following command:

        .. parsed-literal::

           helm upgrade cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\
              --namespace kube-system \\
              --reuse-values \\
              --set hubble.relay.enabled=true \\
              --set hubble.ui.enabled=true


Install the Hubble Client
=========================

In order to access the observability data collected by Hubble, install the
Hubble CLI:

.. include:: hubble-install.rst

Validate Hubble API Access
====================================

In order to access the Hubble API, create a port forward to the Hubble service
from your local machine. This will allow you to connect the Hubble client to
the local port ``4245`` and access the Hubble Relay service in your Kubernetes
cluster. For more information on this method, see `Use Port Forwarding to Access Application in a Cluster <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/>`_.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cilium hubble port-forward&
    Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:4245 -> 4245
    Forwarding from [::]:4245 -> 4245

Now you can validate that you can access the Hubble API via the installed CLI:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ hubble status
    Healthcheck (via localhost:4245): Ok
    Current/Max Flows: 11917/12288 (96.98%)
    Flows/s: 11.74
    Connected Nodes: 3/3

You can also query the flow API and look for flows:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hubble observe

.. note::

   If you port forward to a port other than ``4245``, make sure to use the
   ``--server`` flag or ``HUBBLE_SERVER`` environment variable to set the
   Hubble server address (default: ``localhost:4245``). For more information,
   check out Hubble CLI's help message by running ``hubble help status`` or
   ``hubble help observe`` as well as ``hubble config`` for  configuring Hubble
   CLI.
