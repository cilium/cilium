***************************
Getting Started Using Istio
***************************

This document serves as an introduction to using Cilium to enforce
security policies in Kubernetes micro-services managed with Istio.  It
is a detailed walk-through of getting a single-node Cilium + Istio
environment running on your machine.

.. include:: gsg_requirements.rst

.. note::

   If running on minikube, you may need to up the memory and CPUs
   available to the minikube VM from the defaults and/or the
   instructions provided here for the other GSGs. 5 GB and 4 CPUs
   should be enough for this GSG (``--memory=5120 --cpus=4``).

Step 2: Install cilium-istioctl
===============================

.. note::

   Make sure that Cilium is running in your cluster before proceeding.

Download the `cilium enhanced istioctl version 1.5.4 <https://github.com/cilium/istio/releases/tag/1.5.4>`_:

.. tabs::
  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. parsed-literal::

     curl -L https://github.com/cilium/istio/releases/download/1.5.4/cilium-istioctl-1.5.4-linux.tar.gz | tar xz

  .. group-tab:: OSX

    .. parsed-literal::

     curl -L https://github.com/cilium/istio/releases/download/1.5.4/cilium-istioctl-1.5.4-osx.tar.gz | tar xz

.. note::

   Cilium integration, as presented in this Getting Started Guide, has
   been tested with Kubernetes releases 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, and
   1.18. Note that this does *not* work with K8s 1.13.

Deploy the default Istio configuration profile onto Kubernetes:

::

    ./cilium-istioctl manifest apply -y

Add a namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application later:

::

    kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled

Step 3: Deploy the Bookinfo Application V1
==========================================

Now that we have Cilium and Istio deployed, we can deploy version
``v1`` of the services of the `Istio Bookinfo sample application
<https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo.html>`_.

While the upstream `Istio Bookinfo Application example for Kubernetes
<https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/#if-you-are-running-on-kubernetes>`_
deploys multiple versions of the Bookinfo application at the same time,
here we first deploy only the version 1.

The BookInfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

- *productpage*. The productpage microservice calls the details and
  reviews microservices to populate the page.
- *details*. The details microservice contains book information.
- *reviews*. The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also
  calls the ratings microservice.
- *ratings*. The ratings microservice contains book ranking
  information that accompanies a book review.

In this demo, each specific version of each microservice is deployed
into Kubernetes using separate YAML files which define:

- A Kubernetes Service.
- A Kubernetes Deployment specifying the microservice's pods, specific
  to each service version.
- A Cilium Network Policy limiting the traffic to the microservice,
  specific to each service version.

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-v1.png
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center

To deploy the application with manual sidecar injection, run:

.. parsed-literal::

    for service in productpage-service productpage-v1 details-v1 reviews-v1; do \\
          kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-${service}.yaml ; done

Check the progress of the deployment (every service should have an
``AVAILABLE`` count of ``1``):

::

    watch "kubectl get deployments"
    NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    details-v1       1/1     1            1           12s
    productpage-v1   1/1     1            1           13s
    reviews-v1       1/1     1            1           12s

.. only:: not (epub or latex or html)

   Notes for Istio debugging:
   - Set istio proxy to debug or trace mode:
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=productpage -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -c istio-proxy -- curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:15000/logging?level=debug
   - Check that bpf is mounted:
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=productpage -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -c istio-proxy -- ls -la /sys/fs/bpf/tc/globals
   - Upgrade cilium to a local image (after setting image pull policy to never):
   export CILIUM_TAG=my-test-tag
   docker save cilium/cilium:${CILIUM_TAG} -o cilium-${CILIUM_TAG}.tar
   scp -i $(minikube ssh-key) cilium-${CILIUM_TAG}.tar docker@$(minikube ip):.
   minikube ssh "docker image load -i cilium-${CILIUM_TAG}.tar"
   kubectl -n kube-system set image daemonset/cilium cilium-agent=docker.io/cilium/cilium:${CILIUM_TAG}

Create an Istio ingress gateway for the productpage service:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-gateway.yaml

To obtain the URL to the frontend productpage service, run:

::

    export GATEWAY_URL=http://$(minikube ip):$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}')
    export PRODUCTPAGE_URL=${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage
    open ${PRODUCTPAGE_URL}

Open that URL in your web browser and check that the application has
been successfully deployed.  It may take several seconds before all
services become accessible in the Istio service mesh, so you may have
have to reload the page.

Step 4: Canary and Deploy the Reviews Service V2
================================================

We will now deploy version ``v2`` of the ``reviews`` service.  In
addition to providing reviews from readers, ``reviews v2`` queries a
new ``ratings`` service for book ratings, and displays each rating as
1 to 5 black stars.

As a precaution, we will use Istio's service routing feature to canary
the ``v2`` deployment to prevent breaking the end-to-end application
completely if it is faulty.

Before deploying ``v2``, to prevent any traffic from being routed to
it for now, we will create this Istio route rules to route 100% of the
``reviews`` traffic to ``v1``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/kubernetes-istio/route-rule-reviews-v1.yaml

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-reviews-v2-route-to-v1.png
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center

Apply this route rule:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/route-rule-reviews-v1.yaml

Deploy the ``ratings v1`` and ``reviews v2`` services:

.. parsed-literal::

    for service in ratings-v1 reviews-v2; do \\
          kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-${service}.yaml ; done

Check the progress of the deployment (every service should have an
``AVAILABLE`` count of ``1``):

::

    watch "kubectl get deployments"
    NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    details-v1       1/1     1            1           17m
    productpage-v1   1/1     1            1           17m
    ratings-v1       1/1     1            1           69s
    reviews-v1       1/1     1            1           17m
    reviews-v2       1/1     1            1           68s

Check in your web browser that no stars are appearing in the Book
Reviews, even after refreshing the page several times.  This indicates
that all reviews are retrieved from ``reviews v1`` and none from
``reviews v2``.

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-reviews-v1.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

The ``ratings-v1`` CiliumNetworkPolicy explicitly whitelists access
to the ``ratings`` API only from ``productpage`` and ``reviews v2``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-ratings-v1-policy.yaml

Check that ``reviews v1`` may not be able to access the ``ratings``
service, even if it were compromised or suffered from a bug, by
running ``curl`` from within the pod:

.. note::

   All traffic from ``reviews v1`` to ``ratings`` is blocked, so the
   connection attempt fails after the connection timeout.

::

    export POD_REVIEWS_V1=`kubectl get pods -l app=reviews,version=v1 -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`
    kubectl exec ${POD_REVIEWS_V1} -c istio-proxy -ti -- curl --connect-timeout 5 --fail http://ratings:9080/ratings/0
    curl: (28) Connection timed out after 5001 milliseconds
    command terminated with exit code 28

Update the Istio route rule to send 50% of ``reviews`` traffic to
``v1`` and 50% to ``v2``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/kubernetes-istio/route-rule-reviews-v1-v2.yaml

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-reviews-v2-route-to-v1-and-v2.png
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center

Apply this route rule:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/route-rule-reviews-v1-v2.yaml

Check in your web browser that stars are appearing in the Book Reviews
roughly 50% of the time.  This may require refreshing the page for a
few seconds to observe.  Queries to ``reviews v2`` result in reviews
containing ratings displayed as black stars:

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-reviews-v2.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

Finally, update the route rule to send 100% of ``reviews`` traffic to
``v2``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/kubernetes-istio/route-rule-reviews-v2.yaml

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-reviews-v2-route-to-v2.png
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center

Apply this route rule:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/route-rule-reviews-v2.yaml

Refresh the product page in your web browser several times to verify
that stars are now appearing in the Book Reviews on every page
refresh.  All the reviews are now retrieved from ``reviews v2`` and
none from ``reviews v1``.

Step 5: Deploy the Product Page Service V2
==========================================

We will now deploy version ``v2`` of the ``productpage`` service,
which brings two changes:

- It is deployed with a more restrictive CiliumNetworkPolicy, which
  restricts access to a subset of the HTTP URLs, at Layer-7.
- It implements a new authentication audit log into Kafka.

.. image:: images/istio-bookinfo-productpage-v2-kafka.png
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center

The policy for ``v1`` currently allows read access to the full HTTP
REST API, under the ``/api/v1`` HTTP URI path:

- ``/api/v1/products``: Returns the list of books and their details.
- ``/api/v1/products/<id>``: Returns details about a specific book.
- ``/api/v1/products/<id>/reviews``: Returns reviews for a specific
  book.
- ``/api/v1/products/<id>/ratings``: Returns ratings for a specific
  book.

Check that the full REST API is currently accessible in ``v1`` and
returns valid JSON data:

::

    for APIPATH in /api/v1/products /api/v1/products/0 /api/v1/products/0/reviews /api/v1/products/0/ratings; do echo ; curl -s -S "${GATEWAY_URL}${APIPATH}" ; echo ; done


The output will be similar to this:

::

    [{"descriptionHtml": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Errors\">Wikipedia Summary</a>: The Comedy of Errors is one of <b>William Shakespeare's</b> early plays. It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, in addition to puns and word play.", "id": 0, "title": "The Comedy of Errors"}]

    {"publisher": "PublisherA", "language": "English", "author": "William Shakespeare", "id": 0, "ISBN-10": "1234567890", "ISBN-13": "123-1234567890", "year": 1595, "type": "paperback", "pages": 200}

    {"reviews": [{"reviewer": "Reviewer1", "rating": {"color": "black", "stars": 5}, "text": "An extremely entertaining play by Shakespeare. The slapstick humour is refreshing!"}, {"reviewer": "Reviewer2", "rating": {"color": "black", "stars": 4}, "text": "Absolutely fun and entertaining. The play lacks thematic depth when compared to other plays by Shakespeare."}], "id": "0"}

    {"ratings": {"Reviewer2": 4, "Reviewer1": 5}, "id": 0}

We realized that the REST API to get the book reviews and ratings was
meant only for consumption by other internal services, and will be
blocked from external clients using the updated Layer-7
CiliumNetworkPolicy in ``productpage v2``, i.e. only the
``/api/v1/products`` and ``/api/v1/products/<id>`` HTTP URLs will be
whitelisted:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-productpage-v2-policy.yaml

Because ``productpage v2`` sends messages into Kafka, we must first
deploy a Kafka broker:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/kafka-v1-destrule.yaml

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/kafka-v1.yaml

Wait until the ``kafka-v1-0`` pod is ready, i.e. until it has a
``READY`` count of ``1/1``:

::

    watch "kubectl get pods -l app=kafka"
    NAME         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kafka-v1-0   1/1       Running   0          21m

Create the ``authaudit`` Kafka topic, which will be used by
``productpage v2``:

::

    kubectl exec kafka-v1-0 -c kafka -- bash -c '/opt/kafka_2.11-0.10.1.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181/kafka --create --topic authaudit --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1'

We are now ready to deploy ``productpage v2``.

Create the ``productpage v2`` service and its updated
CiliumNetworkPolicy and delete ``productpage v1``:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-productpage-v2.yaml

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl delete -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/bookinfo-productpage-v1.yaml

``productpage v2`` implements an authorization audit logging.  On
every user login or logout, it produces into Kafka topic ``authaudit``
a JSON-formatted message which contains the following information:

- event: ``login`` or ``logout``
- username
- client IP address
- timestamp

To observe the Kafka messages sent by ``productpage``, we will run an
additional ``authaudit-logger`` service.  This service fetches and
prints out all messages from the ``authaudit`` Kafka topic.  Start
this service:

.. parsed-literal::

    kubectl apply -f \ |SCM_WEB|\/examples/kubernetes-istio/authaudit-logger-v1.yaml

Check the progress of the deployment (every service should have an
``AVAILABLE`` count of ``1``):

::

    watch "kubectl get deployments"
    NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    authaudit-logger-v1   1/1     1            1           41s
    details-v1            1/1     1            1           37m
    productpage-v2        1/1     1            1           4m47s
    ratings-v1            1/1     1            1           20m
    reviews-v1            1/1     1            1           37m
    reviews-v2            1/1     1            1           20m

Check that the product REST API is still accessible, and that Cilium
now denies at Layer-7 any access to the reviews and ratings REST API:

::

    for APIPATH in /api/v1/products /api/v1/products/0 /api/v1/products/0/reviews /api/v1/products/0/ratings; do echo ; curl -s -S "${GATEWAY_URL}${APIPATH}" ; echo ; done

The output will be similar to this:

::

    [{"descriptionHtml": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Errors\">Wikipedia Summary</a>: The Comedy of Errors is one of <b>William Shakespeare's</b> early plays. It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, in addition to puns and word play.", "id": 0, "title": "The Comedy of Errors"}]

    {"publisher": "PublisherA", "language": "English", "author": "William Shakespeare", "id": 0, "ISBN-10": "1234567890", "ISBN-13": "123-1234567890", "year": 1595, "type": "paperback", "pages": 200}

    Access denied


    Access denied

This demonstrated that requests to the
``/api/v1/products/<id>/reviews`` and
``/api/v1/products/<id>/ratings`` URIs now result in Cilium returning
``HTTP 403 Forbidden`` HTTP responses.

Every login and logout on the product page will result in a line in
this service's log. Note that you need to log in/out using the ``sign
in``/``sign out`` element on the bookinfo web page. When you do, you
can observe these kind of audit logs:

::

    export POD_LOGGER_V1=`kubectl get pods -l app=authaudit-logger,version=v1 -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`

::

    kubectl logs ${POD_LOGGER_V1} -c authaudit-logger
    ...
    {"timestamp": "2017-12-04T09:34:24.341668", "remote_addr": "10.15.28.238", "event": "login", "user": "richard"}
    {"timestamp": "2017-12-04T09:34:40.943772", "remote_addr": "10.15.28.238", "event": "logout", "user": "richard"}
    {"timestamp": "2017-12-04T09:35:03.096497", "remote_addr": "10.15.28.238", "event": "login", "user": "gilfoyle"}
    {"timestamp": "2017-12-04T09:35:08.777389", "remote_addr": "10.15.28.238", "event": "logout", "user": "gilfoyle"}

As you can see, the user-identifiable information sent by
``productpage`` in every Kafka message is sensitive, so access to this
Kafka topic must be protected using Cilium.  The CiliumNetworkPolicy
configured on the Kafka broker enforces that:

- only ``productpage v2`` is allowed to produce messages into the
  ``authaudit`` topic;
- only ``authaudit-logger`` can fetch messages from this topic;
- no service can access any other topic.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/kubernetes-istio/kafka-v1-policy.yaml

Check that Cilium prevents the ``authaudit-logger`` service from
writing into the ``authaudit`` topic (enter a message followed by
ENTER, e.g. ``test message``)

.. note::

   Note that the error message may take a short time to appear.

.. note::

   You can terminate the command with a single ``<CTRL>-d``.

::

    kubectl exec ${POD_LOGGER_V1} -c authaudit-logger -ti -- /opt/kafka_2.11-0.10.1.0/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list=kafka:9092 --topic=authaudit
    test message
    [2017-12-07 02:13:47,020] ERROR Error when sending message to topic authaudit with key: null, value: 12 bytes with error: (org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.ErrorLoggingCallback)
    org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access topics: [authaudit]

This demonstrated that Cilium sent a response with an authorization
error for any ``Produce`` request from this service.

Create another topic named ``credit-card-payments``, meant to transmit
highly-sensitive credit card payment requests:

::

    kubectl exec kafka-v1-0 -c kafka -- bash -c '/opt/kafka_2.11-0.10.1.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181/kafka --create --topic credit-card-payments --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1'

Check that Cilium prevents the ``authaudit-logger`` service from
fetching messages from this topic:

::

    kubectl exec ${POD_LOGGER_V1} -c authaudit-logger -ti -- /opt/kafka_2.11-0.10.1.0/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server=kafka:9092 --topic=credit-card-payments

    org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access topics: [credit-card-payments]
    Processed a total of 0 messages

This demonstrated that Cilium sent a response with an authorization
error for any ``Fetch`` request from this service for any topic other
than ``authaudit``.

.. note::

   At present, the above command may also result in an error message.

Step 6: Clean Up
================

You have now installed Cilium and Istio, deployed a demo app, and
tested both Cilium's L3-L7 network security policies and Istio's
service route rules.  To clean up, run:

::

    minikube delete

After this, you can re-run the tutorial from Step 0.
