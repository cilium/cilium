Code owners are used by the Cilium community to consolidate common knowledge
into teams that can provide consistent and actionable feedback to
contributors. This section will describe groups of teams and suggestions
about the focus areas for review.

The primary motivation for these teams is to provide structure around review
processes to ensure that contributors know how to reach out to community
members to conduct discussions, ensure contributions meet the expectations of
the community, and align on the direction of proposed changes. Furthermore,
while these teams are primarily drawn upon to provide review on specific pull
requests, they are also encouraged to self-organize around how to make
improvements to their areas of the Cilium project over time.

Any committer may self-nominate to code owner teams. Reach out to the core
team on the #committers channel in Slack to coordinate. Committers do not
require expert knowledge in an area in order to join a code owner team,
only a willingness to engage in discussions and learn about the area.

Project-wide
++++++++++++

These code owners may provide feedback for Pull Requests submitted to any
repository in the Cilium project:

- `@cilium/api <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/api>`__:
  Ensure the backwards-compatibility of Cilium REST and gRPC APIs, excluding
  Hubble which is owned by `@cilium/sig-hubble-api <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/sig-hubble-api>`__.
- `@cilium/build <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/build>`__:
  Provide feedback on languages and scripting used for build and packaging
  system: Make, Shell, Docker.
- `@cilium/cli <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/cli>`__:
  Provide user experience feedback on changes to Command-Line Interfaces.
  These owners are a stand-in for the user community to bring a user
  perspective to the review process. Consider how information is presented,
  consistency of flags and options.
- `@cilium/ci-structure <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/ci-structure>`__:
  Provide guidance around the best use of Cilium project continuous
  integration and testing infrastructure, including GitHub actions, VM
  helpers, testing frameworks, etc.
- `@cilium/contributing <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/contributing>`__:
  Encourage practices that ensure an inclusive contributor community. Review
  tooling and scripts used by contributors.
- `@cilium/docs-structure <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/docs-structure>`__:
  Ensure the consistency and layout of documentation. General feedback on the
  use of Sphinx, how to communicate content clearly to the community. This
  code owner is not expected to validate the technical correctness of
  submissions. Correctness is typically handled by another code owner group
  which is also assigned to any given piece of documentation.
- `@cilium/sig-foundations <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/sig-foundations>`__:
  Review changes to the core libraries and provide guidance to overall
  software architecture.
- `@cilium/github-sec <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/github-sec>`__:
  Responsible for maintaining the security of repositories in the Cilium
  project by maintaining best practices for workflow usage, for instance
  preventing malicious use of GitHub actions.
- `@cilium/helm <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/helm>`__:
  Provide input on the way that Helm can be used to configure features. These
  owners are a stand-in for the user community to bring a user perspective to
  the review process. Ensure that Helm changes are defined in manners that
  will be forward-compatible for upgrade and follow best practices for
  deployment (for example, being GitOps-friendly).
- `@cilium/sig-hubble-api <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/sig-hubble-api>`__:
  Review all Hubble API related changes. The Hubble API covers gRPC and
  metrics endpoints. The team ensures that API changes are backward
  compatible or that a new API version is created for backward incompatible
  changes.
- `@cilium/metrics <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/metrics>`__:
  Provide recommendations about the types, names and labels for metrics to
  follow best practices. This includes considering the cardinality impact of
  metrics being added or extended.
- `@cilium/security <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/security>`__:
  Provide feedback on changes that could have security implications for Cilium,
  and maintain security-related documentation.
- `@cilium/tophat <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/tophat>`__:
  Top Hat duties rotate between the committer group from week to week, and
  they may assist in maintenance, triage and backporting duties across
  different Cilium repositories. Catch-all for code not otherwise owned by a
  team.
- `@cilium/vendor <https://github.com/orgs/cilium/teams/vendor>`__:
  Review vendor updates for software dependencies to check for any potential
  upstream breakages / incompatibilities. Discourage the use of unofficial
  forks of upstream libraries if they are actively maintained.
