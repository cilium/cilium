Installation on OpenShift OKD
*****************************

OpenShift Requirements
======================

1. Choose preferred cloud provider. This guide was tested in AWS, Azure, and GCP
   from a Linux host.

2. Read `OpenShift documentation <https://docs.okd.io/latest/welcome/index.html>`_ to find out about provider-specific prerequisites.

3. `Get OpenShift Installer <https://github.com/okd-project/okd#getting-started>`_.

.. note::

   It is highly recommended to read the OpenShift documentation, unless you have
   installed OpenShift in the past. Here are a few notes that you may find
   useful.

   - With the AWS provider ``openshift-install`` will not work properly
     when MFA credentials are stored in ``~/.aws/credentials``, traditional credentials are required.
   - With the Azure provider ``openshift-install`` will prompt for
     credentials and store them in ``~/.azure/osServicePrincipal.json``, it
     doesn't simply pickup ``az login`` credentials. It's recommended to
     setup a dedicated service principal and use it.
   - With the GCP provider ``openshift-install`` will only work with a service
     account key, which has to be set using ``GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS``
     environment variable (e.g. ``GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=service-account.json``).
     Follow `Openshift Installer documentation <https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/gcp/iam.md>`_
     to assign required roles to your service account.

Create an OpenShift OKD Cluster
===============================

First, set the cluster name:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   CLUSTER_NAME="cluster-1"

Now, create configuration files:

.. note::

   The sample output below is showing the AWS provider, but
   it should work the same way with other providers.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ openshift-install create install-config --dir "${CLUSTER_NAME}"
   ? SSH Public Key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ? Platform aws
   INFO Credentials loaded from default AWS environment variables
   ? Region eu-west-1
   ? Base Domain openshift-test-1.cilium.rocks
   ? Cluster Name cluster-1
   ? Pull Secret [? for help] **********************************

And set ``networkType: Cilium``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   sed -i "s/networkType: .*/networkType: Cilium/" "${CLUSTER_NAME}/install-config.yaml"

The resulting configuration will look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   baseDomain: ilya-openshift-test-1.cilium.rocks
   compute:
   - architecture: amd64
     hyperthreading: Enabled
     name: worker
     platform: {}
     replicas: 3
   controlPlane:
     architecture: amd64
     hyperthreading: Enabled
     name: master
     platform: {}
     replicas: 3
   metadata:
     creationTimestamp: null
     name: cluster-1
   networking:
     clusterNetwork:
     - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
       hostPrefix: 23
     machineNetwork:
     - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
     networkType: Cilium
     serviceNetwork:
     - 172.30.0.0/16
   platform:
     aws:
       region: eu-west-1
   publish: External
   pullSecret: '{"auths":{"fake":{"auth": "bar"}}}'
   sshKey: |
     ssh-rsa <REDACTED>

You may wish to make a few changes, e.g. increase the number of nodes.

If you do change any of the CIDRs, you will need to make sure that Helm values in ``${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests/cluster-network-07-cilium-ciliumconfig.yaml``
reflect those changes. Namely ``clusterNetwork`` should match ``ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR``, ``clusterPoolIPv4PodCIDRList`` and ``clusterPoolIPv4MaskSize``.
Also make sure that the ``clusterNetwork`` does not conflict with ``machineNetwork`` (which represents the VPC CIDR in AWS).

.. warning::

   Ensure that there are multiple replicas of the ``controlPlane``. A single
   ``controlPlane`` will lead to failure to bootstrap the cluster during
   installation.

Next, generate OpenShift manifests:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   openshift-install create manifests --dir "${CLUSTER_NAME}"

Next, obtain Cilium manifest from ``cilium/cilium-olm`` repository and copy to ``${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests``:

.. parsed-literal::

   cilium_version="\ |release|\ "
   git_dir="/tmp/cilium-olm"

   git clone https://github.com/cilium/cilium-olm.git ${git_dir}
   cp ${git_dir}/manifests/cilium.v${cilium_version}/* "${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests"

   test -d ${git_dir} && rm -rf -- ${git_dir}

At this stage manifest directory contains all that is needed to install Cilium.
To get a list of the Cilium manifests, run:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   ls ${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests/cluster-network-*-cilium-*

You can set any custom Helm values by editing ``${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests/cluster-network-07-cilium-ciliumconfig.yaml``.

It is also possible to update Helm values once the cluster is running by
changing the ``CiliumConfig`` object, e.g. with ``kubectl edit ciliumconfig -n
cilium cilium``. You may need to restart the Cilium agent pods for certain
options to take effect.

.. note::

   If you are not using a real OpenShift pull secret, you will not be able to install the Cilium OLM operator
   using RedHat registry. You can fix this by running:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

       sed -i 's|image:\ registry.connect.redhat.com/isovalent/|image:\ quay.io/cilium/|g' \
         "${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests/cluster-network-06-cilium-00002-cilium-olm-deployment.yaml" \
         ${CLUSTER_NAME}/manifests/cluster-network-06-cilium-00014-cilium.*-clusterserviceversion.yaml


Create the cluster:

.. note::

   The sample output below is showing the AWS provider, but
   it should work the same way with other providers.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ openshift-install create cluster --dir "${CLUSTER_NAME}"

Accessing the cluster
---------------------

To access the cluster you will need to use ``kubeconfig`` file from the ``${CLUSTER_NAME}/auth`` directory:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   export KUBECONFIG="${CLUSTER_NAME}/auth/kubeconfig"

Prepare cluster for Cilium connectivity test
--------------------------------------------

In order for Cilium connectivity test pods to run on OpenShift, a simple custom ``SecurityContextConstraints``
object is required. It will to allow ``hostPort``/``hostNetwork`` that some of the connectivity test pods rely on,
it sets only ``allowHostPorts`` and ``allowHostNetwork`` without any other privileges.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
   kind: SecurityContextConstraints
   metadata:
     name: cilium-test
   allowHostPorts: true
   allowHostNetwork: true
   users:
     - system:serviceaccount:cilium-test:default
   priority: null
   readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
   runAsUser:
     type: MustRunAsRange
   seLinuxContext:
     type: MustRunAs
   volumes: null
   allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
   allowHostIPC: false
   allowHostPID: false
   allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
   allowPrivilegedContainer: false
   allowedCapabilities: null
   defaultAddCapabilities: null
   requiredDropCapabilities: null
   groups: null
   EOF

Deploy the connectivity test
----------------------------

.. include:: kubectl-connectivity-test.rst

Cleanup after connectivity test
-------------------------------

Remove the ``SecurityContextConstraints``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   kubectl delete scc cilium-test

Delete the cluster
------------------

.. code-block:: shell-session

   openshift-install destroy cluster --dir="${CLUSTER_NAME}"
