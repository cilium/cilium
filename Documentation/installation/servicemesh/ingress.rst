**************************
Kubernetes Ingress Support
**************************

Cilium uses the standard Kubernetes Ingress resource definition, with
an ``ingressClassName`` of ``cilium``. This can be used for path-based
routing and for TLS termination.

.. Note::

    The ingress controller creates a service of LoadBalancer type, so
    your environment will need to support this.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to enable the Ingress Controller in
an existing K8s cluster with Cilium installed.
