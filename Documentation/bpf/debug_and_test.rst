Debugging and Testing
=====================

bpftool
-------

bpftool is the main introspection and debugging tool around BPF and developed
and shipped along with the Linux kernel tree under ``tools/bpf/bpftool/``.

The tool can dump all BPF programs and maps that are currently loaded in
the system, or list and correlate all BPF maps used by a specific program.
Furthermore, it allows to dump the entire map's key / value pairs, or
lookup, update, delete individual ones as well as retrieve a key's neighbor
key in the map. Such operations can be performed based on BPF program or
map IDs or by specifying the location of a BPF file system pinned program
or map. The tool additionally also offers an option to pin maps or programs
into the BPF file system.

For a quick overview of all BPF programs currently loaded on the host
invoke the following command:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog
     398: sched_cls  tag 56207908be8ad877
        loaded_at Apr 09/16:24  uid 0
        xlated 8800B  jited 6184B  memlock 12288B  map_ids 18,5,17,14
     399: sched_cls  tag abc95fb4835a6ec9
        loaded_at Apr 09/16:24  uid 0
        xlated 344B  jited 223B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 18
     400: sched_cls  tag afd2e542b30ff3ec
        loaded_at Apr 09/16:24  uid 0
        xlated 1720B  jited 1001B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 17
     401: sched_cls  tag 2dbbd74ee5d51cc8
        loaded_at Apr 09/16:24  uid 0
        xlated 3728B  jited 2099B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 17
     [...]

Similarly, to get an overview of all active maps:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # bpftool map
    5: hash  flags 0x0
        key 20B  value 112B  max_entries 65535  memlock 13111296B
    6: hash  flags 0x0
        key 20B  value 20B  max_entries 65536  memlock 7344128B
    7: hash  flags 0x0
        key 10B  value 16B  max_entries 8192  memlock 790528B
    8: hash  flags 0x0
        key 22B  value 28B  max_entries 8192  memlock 987136B
    9: hash  flags 0x0
        key 20B  value 8B  max_entries 512000  memlock 49352704B
    [...]

Note that for each command, bpftool also supports json based output by
appending ``--json`` at the end of the command line. An additional
``--pretty`` improves the output to be more human readable.

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog --json --pretty

For dumping the post-verifier BPF instruction image of a specific BPF
program, one starting point could be to inspect a specific program, e.g.
attached to the tc ingress hook:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # tc filter show dev cilium_host egress
     filter protocol all pref 1 bpf chain 0
     filter protocol all pref 1 bpf chain 0 handle 0x1 bpf_host.o:[from-netdev] \
                         direct-action not_in_hw id 406 tag e0362f5bd9163a0a jited

The program from the object file ``bpf_host.o``, section ``from-netdev`` has
a BPF program ID of ``406`` as denoted in ``id 406``. Based on this information
bpftool can provide some high-level metadata specific to the program:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog show id 406
     406: sched_cls  tag e0362f5bd9163a0a
          loaded_at Apr 09/16:24  uid 0
          xlated 11144B  jited 7721B  memlock 12288B  map_ids 18,20,8,5,6,14

The program of ID 406 is of type ``sched_cls`` (``BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS``),
has a ``tag`` of ``e0362f5bd9163a0a`` (SHA sum over the instruction sequence),
it was loaded by root ``uid 0`` on ``Apr 09/16:24``. The BPF instruction
sequence is ``11,144 bytes`` long and the JITed image ``7,721 bytes``. The
program itself (excluding maps) consumes ``12,288 bytes`` that are accounted /
charged against user ``uid 0``. And the BPF program uses the BPF maps with
IDs ``18``, ``20``, ``8``, ``5``, ``6`` and ``14``. The latter IDs can further
be used to get information or dump the map themselves.

Additionally, bpftool can issue a dump request of the BPF instructions the
program runs:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 406
      0: (b7) r7 = 0
      1: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +60) = r7
      2: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +56) = r7
      3: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +52) = r7
     [...]
     47: (bf) r4 = r10
     48: (07) r4 += -40
     49: (79) r6 = *(u64 *)(r10 -104)
     50: (bf) r1 = r6
     51: (18) r2 = map[id:18]                    <-- BPF map id 18
     53: (b7) r5 = 32
     54: (85) call bpf_skb_event_output#5656112  <-- BPF helper call
     55: (69) r1 = *(u16 *)(r6 +192)
     [...]

bpftool correlates BPF map IDs into the instruction stream as shown above
as well as calls to BPF helpers or other BPF programs.

The instruction dump reuses the same 'pretty-printer' as the kernel's BPF
verifier. Since the program was JITed and therefore the actual JIT image
that was generated out of above ``xlated`` instructions is executed, it
can be dumped as well through bpftool:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump jited id 406
      0:        push   %rbp
      1:        mov    %rsp,%rbp
      4:        sub    $0x228,%rsp
      b:        sub    $0x28,%rbp
      f:        mov    %rbx,0x0(%rbp)
     13:        mov    %r13,0x8(%rbp)
     17:        mov    %r14,0x10(%rbp)
     1b:        mov    %r15,0x18(%rbp)
     1f:        xor    %eax,%eax
     21:        mov    %rax,0x20(%rbp)
     25:        mov    0x80(%rdi),%r9d
     [...]

Mainly for BPF JIT developers, the option also exists to interleave the
disassembly with the actual native opcodes:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump jited id 406 opcodes
      0:        push   %rbp
                55
      1:        mov    %rsp,%rbp
                48 89 e5
      4:        sub    $0x228,%rsp
                48 81 ec 28 02 00 00
      b:        sub    $0x28,%rbp
                48 83 ed 28
      f:        mov    %rbx,0x0(%rbp)
                48 89 5d 00
     13:        mov    %r13,0x8(%rbp)
                4c 89 6d 08
     17:        mov    %r14,0x10(%rbp)
                4c 89 75 10
     1b:        mov    %r15,0x18(%rbp)
                4c 89 7d 18
     [...]

The same interleaving can be done for the normal BPF instructions which
can sometimes be useful for debugging in the kernel:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 406 opcodes
      0: (b7) r7 = 0
         b7 07 00 00 00 00 00 00
      1: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +60) = r7
         63 71 3c 00 00 00 00 00
      2: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +56) = r7
         63 71 38 00 00 00 00 00
      3: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +52) = r7
         63 71 34 00 00 00 00 00
      4: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +48) = r7
         63 71 30 00 00 00 00 00
      5: (63) *(u32 *)(r1 +64) = r7
         63 71 40 00 00 00 00 00
      [...]

The basic blocks of a program can also be visualized with the help of
``graphviz``. For this purpose bpftool has a ``visual`` dump mode that
generates a dot file instead of the plain BPF ``xlated`` instruction
dump that can later be converted to a png file:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 406 visual &> output.dot
     $ dot -Tpng output.dot -o output.png

Another option would be to pass the dot file to dotty as a viewer, that
is ``dotty output.dot``, where the result for the ``bpf_host.o`` program
looks as follows (small extract):

.. image:: /images/bpf_dot.png
    :align: center

Note that the ``xlated`` instruction dump provides the post-verifier BPF
instruction image which means that it dumps the instructions as if they
were to be run through the BPF interpreter. In the kernel, the verifier
performs various rewrites of the original instructions provided by the
BPF loader.

One example of rewrites is the inlining of helper functions in order to
improve runtime performance, here in the case of a map lookup for hash
tables:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 3
      0: (b7) r1 = 2
      1: (63) *(u32 *)(r10 -4) = r1
      2: (bf) r2 = r10
      3: (07) r2 += -4
      4: (18) r1 = map[id:2]                      <-- BPF map id 2
      6: (85) call __htab_map_lookup_elem#77408   <-+ BPF helper inlined rewrite
      7: (15) if r0 == 0x0 goto pc+2                |
      8: (07) r0 += 56                              |
      9: (79) r0 = *(u64 *)(r0 +0)                <-+
     10: (15) if r0 == 0x0 goto pc+24
     11: (bf) r2 = r10
     12: (07) r2 += -4
     [...]

bpftool correlates calls to helper functions or BPF to BPF calls through
kallsyms. Therefore, make sure that JITed BPF programs are exposed to
kallsyms (``bpf_jit_kallsyms``) and that kallsyms addresses are not
obfuscated (calls are otherwise shown as ``call bpf_unspec#0``):

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
     # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_kallsyms

BPF to BPF calls are correlated as well for both, interpreter as well
as JIT case. In the latter, the tag of the subprogram is shown as
call target. In each case, the ``pc+2`` is the pc-relative offset of
the call target, which denotes the subprogram.

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 1
     0: (85) call pc+2#__bpf_prog_run_args32
     1: (b7) r0 = 1
     2: (95) exit
     3: (b7) r0 = 2
     4: (95) exit

JITed variant of the dump:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 1
     0: (85) call pc+2#bpf_prog_3b185187f1855c4c_F
     1: (b7) r0 = 1
     2: (95) exit
     3: (b7) r0 = 2
     4: (95) exit

In the case of tail calls, the kernel maps them into a single instruction
internally, bpftool will still correlate them as a helper call for ease
of debugging:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog dump xlated id 2
     [...]
     10: (b7) r2 = 8
     11: (85) call bpf_trace_printk#-41312
     12: (bf) r1 = r6
     13: (18) r2 = map[id:1]
     15: (b7) r3 = 0
     16: (85) call bpf_tail_call#12
     17: (b7) r1 = 42
     18: (6b) *(u16 *)(r6 +46) = r1
     19: (b7) r0 = 0
     20: (95) exit

     # bpftool map show id 1
     1: prog_array  flags 0x0
           key 4B  value 4B  max_entries 1  memlock 4096B

Dumping an entire map is possible through the ``map dump`` subcommand
which iterates through all present map elements and dumps the key /
value pairs.

If no BTF (BPF Type Format) data is available for a given map, then
the key / value pairs are dumped as hex:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool map dump id 5
     key:
     f0 0d 00 00 00 00 00 00  0a 66 00 00 00 00 8a d6
     02 00 00 00
     value:
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     key:
     0a 66 1c ee 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     01 00 00 00
     value:
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
     [...]
     Found 6 elements

However, with BTF, the map also holds debugging information about
the key and value structures. For example, BTF in combination with
BPF maps and the BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR() macro from iproute2 will
result in the following dump (``test_xdp_noinline.o`` from kernel
selftests):

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # cat tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_xdp_noinline.c
       [...]
        struct ctl_value {
              union {
                      __u64 value;
                      __u32 ifindex;
                      __u8 mac[6];
              };
        };

        struct bpf_map_def __attribute__ ((section("maps"), used)) ctl_array = {
               .type		= BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY,
               .key_size	= sizeof(__u32),
               .value_size	= sizeof(struct ctl_value),
               .max_entries	= 16,
               .map_flags	= 0,
        };
        BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR(ctl_array, __u32, struct ctl_value);

        [...]

The BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR() macro forces a map-specific ELF section
containing an empty key and value, this enables the iproute2 BPF loader
to correlate BTF data with that section and thus allows to choose the
corresponding types out of the BTF for loading the map.

Compiling through LLVM and generating BTF through debugging information
by ``pahole``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # clang [...] -O2 --target=bpf -g -emit-llvm -c test_xdp_noinline.c -o - |
       llc -march=bpf -mcpu=probe -mattr=dwarfris -filetype=obj -o test_xdp_noinline.o
     # pahole -J test_xdp_noinline.o

Now loading into kernel and dumping the map via bpftool:

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # ip -force link set dev lo xdp obj test_xdp_noinline.o sec xdp-test
     # ip a
     1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 xdpgeneric/id:227 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000

                   "ifindex": 0,
                   "mac": []
               }
           }
       },{
           "key": 1,
           "value": {
               "": {
                   "value": 0,
                   "ifindex": 0,
                   "mac": []
               }
           }
       },{
     [...]

Lookup, update, delete, and 'get next key' operations on the map for specific
keys can be performed through bpftool as well.

If the BPF program has been successfully loaded with BTF debugging information,
the BTF ID will be shown in ``prog show`` command result denoted in ``btf_id``.

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool prog show id 72
     72: xdp  name balancer_ingres  tag acf44cabb48385ed  gpl
        loaded_at 2020-04-13T23:12:08+0900  uid 0
        xlated 19104B  jited 10732B  memlock 20480B  map_ids 126,130,131,127,129,128
        btf_id 60

This can also be confirmed with ``btf show`` command which dumps all BTF
objects loaded on a system.

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool btf show
     60: size 12243B  prog_ids 72  map_ids 126,130,131,127,129,128

And the subcommand ``btf dump`` can be used to check which debugging information
is included in the BTF. With this command, BTF dump can be formatted either
'raw' or 'c', the one that is used in C code.

.. code-block:: shell-session

     # bpftool btf dump id 60 format c
       [...]
        struct ctl_value {
              union {
                      __u64 value;
                      __u32 ifindex;
                      __u8 mac[6];
              };
        };

        typedef unsigned int u32;
        [...]

Kernel Testing
--------------

The Linux kernel ships a BPF selftest suite, which can be found in the kernel
source tree under ``tools/testing/selftests/bpf/``.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cd tools/testing/selftests/bpf/
    $ make
    # make run_tests

The test suite contains test cases against the BPF verifier, program tags,
various tests against the BPF map interface and map types. It contains various
runtime tests from C code for checking LLVM back end, and eBPF as well as cBPF
asm code that is run in the kernel for testing the interpreter and JITs.

JIT Debugging

For JIT developers performing audits or writing extensions, each compile run
can output the generated JIT image into the kernel log through:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

Whenever a new BPF program is loaded, the JIT compiler will dump the output,
which can then be inspected with ``dmesg``, for example:

::

    [ 3389.935842] flen=6 proglen=70 pass=3 image=ffffffffa0069c8f from=tcpdump pid=20583
    [ 3389.935847] JIT code: 00000000: 55 48 89 e5 48 83 ec 60 48 89 5d f8 44 8b 4f 68

    [ 3389.935851] JIT code: 00000030: 00 e8 28 94 ff e0 83 f8 01 75 07 b8 ff ff 00 00
    [ 3389.935852] JIT code: 00000040: eb 02 31 c0 c9 c3

``flen`` is the length of the BPF program (here, 6 BPF instructions), and ``proglen``
tells the number of bytes generated by the JIT for the opcode image (here, 70 bytes
in size). ``pass`` means that the image was generated in 3 compiler passes, for
example, ``x86_64`` can have various optimization passes to further reduce the image
size when possible. ``image`` contains the address of the generated JIT image, ``from``
and ``pid`` the user space application name and PID respectively, which triggered the
compilation process. The dump output for eBPF and cBPF JITs is the same format.

In the kernel tree under ``tools/bpf/``, there is a tool called ``bpf_jit_disasm``. It
reads out the latest dump and prints the disassembly for further inspection:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # ./bpf_jit_disasm
    70 bytes emitted from JIT compiler (pass:3, flen:6)
    ffffffffa0069c8f + <x>:

       1:       mov    %rsp,%rbp
       4:       sub    $0x60,%rsp
       8:       mov    %rbx,-0x8(%rbp)
       c:       mov    0x68(%rdi),%r9d
      10:       sub    0x6c(%rdi),%r9d
      14:       mov    0xd8(%rdi),%r8
      1b:       mov    $0xc,%esi
      20:       callq  0xffffffffe0ff9442
      25:       cmp    $0x800,%eax
      2a:       jne    0x0000000000000042
      2c:       mov    $0x17,%esi
      31:       callq  0xffffffffe0ff945e
      36:       cmp    $0x1,%eax
      39:       jne    0x0000000000000042
      3b:       mov    $0xffff,%eax
      40:       jmp    0x0000000000000044
      42:       xor    %eax,%eax
      44:       leaveq
      45:       retq

Alternatively, the tool can also dump related opcodes along with the disassembly.

.. code-block:: shell-session

        c9
      45:       retq
        c3

More recently, ``bpftool`` adapted the same feature of dumping the BPF JIT
image based on a given BPF program ID already loaded in the system (see
bpftool section).

For performance analysis of JITed BPF programs, ``perf`` can be used as
usual. As a prerequisite, JITed programs need to be exported through kallsyms
infrastructure.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable
    # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_kallsyms

Enabling or disabling ``bpf_jit_kallsyms`` does not require a reload of the
related BPF programs. Next, a small workflow example is provided for profiling
BPF programs. A crafted tc BPF program is used for demonstration purposes,
where perf records a failed allocation inside ``bpf_clone_redirect()`` helper.
Due to the use of direct write, ``bpf_try_make_head_writable()`` failed, which
would then release the cloned ``skb`` again and return with an error message.
``perf`` thus records all ``kfree_skb`` events.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # tc qdisc add dev em1 clsact
    # tc filter add dev em1 ingress bpf da obj prog.o sec main
    # tc filter show dev em1 ingress

       7fffb885e09c ret_from_fork (/lib/modules/4.10.0+/build/vmlinux)

The stack trace recorded by ``perf`` will then show the ``bpf_prog_8227addf251b7543()``
symbol as part of the call trace, meaning that the BPF program with the
tag ``8227addf251b7543`` was related to the ``kfree_skb`` event, and
such program was attached to netdevice ``em1`` on the ingress hook as
shown by tc.

Introspection
-------------

The Linux kernel provides various tracepoints around BPF and XDP which
can be used for additional introspection, for example, to trace interactions
of user space programs with the bpf system call.

Tracepoints for BPF:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # perf list | grep bpf:
    bpf:bpf_map_create                                 [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_map_delete_elem                            [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_map_lookup_elem                            [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_map_next_key                               [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_map_update_elem                            [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_obj_get_map                                [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_obj_get_prog                               [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_obj_pin_map                                [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_obj_pin_prog                               [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_prog_get_type                              [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_prog_load                                  [Tracepoint event]
    bpf:bpf_prog_put_rcu                               [Tracepoint event]

Example usage with ``perf`` (alternatively to ``sleep`` example used here,
a specific application like ``tc`` could be used here instead, of course):

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # perf record -a -e bpf:* sleep 10
    # perf script
    sock_example  6197 [005]   283.980322:      bpf:bpf_map_create: map type=ARRAY ufd=4 key=4 val=8 max=256 flags=0
    sock_example  6197 [005]   283.980721:       bpf:bpf_prog_load: prog=a5ea8fa30ea6849c type=SOCKET_FILTER ufd=5
    sock_example  6197 [005]   283.988423:   bpf:bpf_prog_get_type: prog=a5ea8fa30ea6849c type=SOCKET_FILTER
    sock_example  6197 [005]   283.988443: bpf:bpf_map_lookup_elem: map type=ARRAY ufd=4 key=[06 00 00 00] val=[00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]
    [...]
    sock_example  6197 [005]   288.990868: bpf:bpf_map_lookup_elem: map type=ARRAY ufd=4 key=[01 00 00 00] val=[14 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]
         swapper     0 [005]   289.338243:    bpf:bpf_prog_put_rcu: prog=a5ea8fa30ea6849c type=SOCKET_FILTER

For the BPF programs, their individual program tag is displayed.

For debugging, XDP also has a tracepoint that is triggered when exceptions are raised:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # perf list | grep xdp:
    xdp:xdp_exception                                  [Tracepoint event]

Exceptions are triggered in the following scenarios:

* The BPF program returned an invalid / unknown XDP action code.
* The BPF program returned with ``XDP_ABORTED`` indicating a non-graceful exit.
* The BPF program returned with ``XDP_TX``, but there was an error on transmit,
  for example, due to the port not being up, due to the transmit ring being full,
  due to allocation failures, etc.

Both tracepoint classes can also be inspected with a BPF program itself
attached to one or more tracepoints, collecting further information
in a map or punting such events to a user space collector through the
``bpf_perf_event_output()`` helper, for example.

Tracing pipe
------------

When a BPF program makes a call to ``bpf_trace_printk()``, the output is sent
to the kernel tracing pipe. Users may read from this file to consume events
that are traced to this buffer:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   # tail -f /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
   ...


Miscellaneous
-------------

BPF programs and maps are memory accounted against ``RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`` similar
to ``perf``. The currently available size in unit of system pages which may be
locked into memory can be inspected through ``ulimit -l``. The setrlimit system
call man page provides further details.

The default limit is usually insufficient to load more complex programs or
larger BPF maps, so that the BPF system call will return with ``errno``
of ``EPERM``. In such situations a workaround with ``ulimit -l unlimited`` or
with a sufficiently large limit could be performed. The ``RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`` is
mainly enforcing limits for unprivileged users. Depending on the setup,
setting a higher limit for privileged users is often acceptable.
