Kernel Developer FAQ
--------------------

Under ``Documentation/bpf/``, the Linux kernel provides two FAQ files that
are mainly targeted for kernel developers involved in the BPF subsystem.

* **BPF Devel FAQ:** this document provides mostly information around patch
  submission process as well as BPF kernel tree, stable tree and bug
  reporting workflows, questions around BPF's extensibility and interaction
  with LLVM and more.

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/bpf/bpf_devel_QA.rst

..

* **BPF Design FAQ:** this document tries to answer frequently asked questions
  around BPF design decisions related to the instruction set, verifier,
  calling convention, JITs, etc.

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/bpf/bpf_design_QA.rst

Projects using BPF
------------------

The following list includes a selection of open source projects making
use of BPF respectively provide tooling for BPF. In this context the eBPF
instruction set is specifically meant instead of projects utilizing the
legacy cBPF:

**Tracing**

* **BCC**

  BCC stands for BPF Compiler Collection and its key feature is to provide
  a set of easy to use and efficient kernel tracing utilities all based
  upon BPF programs hooking into kernel infrastructure based upon kprobes,
  kretprobes, tracepoints, uprobes, uretprobes as well as USDT probes. The
  collection provides close to hundred tools targeting different layers
  across the stack from applications, system libraries, to the various
  different kernel subsystems in order to analyze a system's performance
  characteristics or problems. Additionally, BCC provides an API in order
  to be used as a library for other projects.

  https://github.com/iovisor/bcc

..

* **bpftrace**

  bpftrace is a DTrace-style dynamic tracing tool for Linux and uses LLVM
  as a back end to compile scripts to BPF-bytecode and makes use of BCC
  for interacting with the kernel's BPF tracing infrastructure. It provides
  a higher-level language for implementing tracing scripts compared to
  native BCC.

  https://github.com/ajor/bpftrace

..

* **perf**

  The perf tool which is developed by the Linux kernel community as
  part of the kernel source tree provides a way to load tracing BPF
  programs through the conventional perf record subcommand where the
  aggregated data from BPF can be retrieved and post processed in
  perf.data for example through perf script and other means.

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/perf

..

* **ply**

  ply is a tracing tool that follows the 'Little Language' approach of
  yore, and compiles ply scripts into Linux BPF programs that are attached
  to kprobes and tracepoints in the kernel. The scripts have a C-like syntax,
  heavily inspired by DTrace and by extension awk. ply keeps dependencies
  to very minimum and only requires flex and bison at build time, only libc
  at runtime.

  https://github.com/wkz/ply

..

* **systemtap**

  systemtap is a scripting language and tool for extracting, filtering and
  summarizing data in order to diagnose and analyze performance or functional
  problems. It comes with a BPF back end called stapbpf which translates
  the script directly into BPF without the need of an additional compiler
  and injects the probe into the kernel. Thus, unlike stap's kernel modules
  this does neither have external dependencies nor requires to load kernel
  modules.

  https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=systemtap.git;a=summary

..

* **PCP**

  Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a system performance and analysis framework
  which is able to collect metrics through a variety of agents as well as
  analyze collected systems' performance metrics in real-time or by using
  historical data. With pmdabcc, PCP has a BCC based performance metrics
  domain agent which extracts data from the kernel via BPF and BCC.

  https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp

..

* **Weave Scope**

  Weave Scope is a cloud monitoring tool collecting data about processes,
  networking connections or other system data by making use of BPF in combination
  with kprobes. Weave Scope works on top of the gobpf library in order to load
  BPF ELF files into the kernel, and comes with a tcptracer-bpf tool which
  monitors connect, accept and close calls in order to trace TCP events.

  https://github.com/weaveworks/scope

..

**Networking**

* **Cilium**

  Cilium provides and transparently secures network connectivity and load-balancing
  between application workloads such as application containers or processes. Cilium
  operates at Layer 3/4 to provide traditional networking and security services
  as well as Layer 7 to protect and secure use of modern application protocols
  such as HTTP, gRPC and Kafka. It is integrated into orchestration frameworks
  such as Kubernetes. BPF is the foundational part of Cilium that operates in
  the kernel's networking data path.

  https://github.com/cilium/cilium

..

* **Suricata**

  Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine, and utilizes BPF as well as XDP
  in three different areas, that is, as BPF filter in order to process or bypass
  certain packets, as a BPF based load balancer in order to allow for programmable
  load balancing and for XDP to implement a bypass or dropping mechanism at high
  packet rates.

  https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-5.0.2/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.html

  https://github.com/OISF/suricata

..

* **systemd**

  systemd allows for IPv4/v6 accounting as well as implementing network access
  control for its systemd units based on BPF's cgroup ingress and egress hooks.
  Accounting is based on packets / bytes, and ACLs can be specified as address
  prefixes for allow / deny rules. More information can be found at:

  http://0pointer.net/blog/ip-accounting-and-access-lists-with-systemd.html

  https://github.com/systemd/systemd

..

* **iproute2**

  iproute2 offers the ability to load BPF programs as LLVM generated ELF files
  into the kernel. iproute2 supports both, XDP BPF programs as well as tc BPF
  programs through a common BPF loader backend. The tc and ip command line
  utilities enable loader and introspection functionality for the user.

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2.git/

..

* **p4c-xdp**

  p4c-xdp presents a P4 compiler backend targeting BPF and XDP. P4 is a domain
  specific language describing how packets are processed by the data plane of
  a programmable network element such as NICs, appliances or switches, and with
  the help of p4c-xdp P4 programs can be translated into BPF C programs which
  can be compiled by clang / LLVM and loaded as BPF programs into the kernel
  at XDP layer for high performance packet processing.

  https://github.com/vmware/p4c-xdp

..

**Others**

* **LLVM**

  clang / LLVM provides the BPF back end in order to compile C BPF programs
  into BPF instructions contained in ELF files. The LLVM BPF back end is
  developed alongside with the BPF core infrastructure in the Linux kernel
  and maintained by the same community. clang / LLVM is a key part in the
  toolchain for developing BPF programs.

  https://llvm.org/

..

* **libbpf**

  libbpf is a generic BPF library which is developed by the Linux kernel
  community as part of the kernel source tree and allows for loading and
  attaching BPF programs from LLVM generated ELF files into the kernel.
  The library is used by other kernel projects such as perf and bpftool.

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/lib/bpf

..

* **bpftool**

  bpftool is the main tool for introspecting and debugging BPF programs
  and BPF maps, and like libbpf is developed by the Linux kernel community.
  It allows for dumping all active BPF programs and maps in the system,
  dumping and disassembling BPF or JITed BPF instructions from a program
  as well as dumping and manipulating BPF maps in the system. bpftool
  supports interaction with the BPF filesystem, loading various program
  types from an object file into the kernel and much more.

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/bpf/bpftool

..

* **cilium/ebpf**

  ``cilium/ebpf`` (ebpf-go) is a pure Go library that provides utilities for
  loading, compiling, and debugging eBPF programs. It has minimal external
  dependencies and is intended to be used in long-running processes.

  Its ``bpf2go`` utility automates away compiling eBPF C programs and embedding
  them into Go binaries.

  It implements attaching programs to various kernel hooks, as well as kprobes
  and uprobes for tracing arbitrary kernel and user space functions. It also
  features a complete assembler that allows constructing eBPF programs at
  runtime using Go, or modifying them after they've been loaded from an ELF
  object.

  https://github.com/cilium/ebpf

..

* **ebpf_asm**

  ebpf_asm provides an assembler for BPF programs written in an Intel-like assembly
  syntax, and therefore offers an alternative for writing BPF programs directly in
  assembly for cases where programs are rather small and simple without needing the
  clang / LLVM toolchain.

  https://github.com/Xilinx-CNS/ebpf_asm
