Developer / Contributor Guide
=============================

We're happy you're interested in contributing to the Cilium project.

This guide will help you make sure you have an environment capable of testing
changes to the Cilium source code, and that you understand the workflow of getting
these changes reviewed and merged upstream.

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

Developer requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to have the following tools available in order to effectively
contribute to Cilium:

To run Cilium locally on VMs, you need:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Dependency                                                                       | Version / Commit ID   | Download Command                                                               |

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Finally, in order to build the documentation, you should have Sphinx installed:

::

    $ sudo pip install sphinx
  
You should start with the :ref:`gs_guide`, which walks you through the
set-up, such as installing Vagrant, getting the Cilium sources, and
going through some Cilium basics.

  
Vagrant Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the :ref:`gs_guide` uses a Vagrantfile tuned for the basic
walk through, the setup for the Vagrantfile in the root of the Cilium
tree depends on a number of environment variables and network setup
that are managed via ``contrib/vagrant/start.sh``.

Using the provided Vagrantfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To bring up a Vagrant VM  with Cilium
plus dependencies installed, run:

::

    $ contrib/vagrant/start.sh

This will create and run a vagrant VM based on the base box
``cilium/ubuntu-16.10``. The box is currently available for the
following providers:

* libvirt
* virtualbox

Options
^^^^^^^

The following environment variables can be set to customize the VMs
brought up by vagrant:

* ``NWORKERS=n``: Number of child nodes you want to start with the master,
  default 0.
* ``RELOAD=1``: Issue a ``vagrant reload`` instead of ``vagrant up``
* ``NFS=1``: Use NFS for vagrant shared directories instead of rsync
* ``K8S=1``: Build & install kubernetes on the nodes
* ``IPV4=1``: Run Cilium with IPv4 enabled
* VAGRANT\_DEFAULT\_PROVIDER={virtualbox \| libvirt \| ...}

If you want to start the VM with cilium enabled with IPv4, with
kubernetes installed and plus a worker, run:

::

	$ IPV4=1 K8S=1 NWORKERS=1 contrib/vagrant/start.sh

If you have any issue with the provided vagrant box
``cilium/ubuntu-16.10`` or need a different box format, you may
build the box yourself using the `packer scripts <https://github.com/cilium/packer-ubuntu-16.10>`_

Manual Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively you can import the vagrant box ``cilium/ubuntu-16.10``
directly and manually install Cilium:

::

        $ vagrant init cilium/ubuntu-16.10
        $ vagrant up
        $ vagrant ssh [...]
        $ cd go/src/github.com/cilium/cilium/
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo cp contrib/upstart/* /etc/init/
        $ sudo usermod -a -G cilium vagrant
        $ sudo service cilium restart

Notes
^^^^^

Your Cilium tree is mapped to the VM so that you do not need to keep
copying files between your host and the VM.  The default sync method
is rsync, which only syncs when the VM is brought up, or when manually
triggered (``vagrant rsync`` command in the Cilium tree).  You can
also use NFS to access your Cilium tree from the VM by setting the
environment variable ``NFS`` (mentioned above) before running the startup script
(``export NFS=1``).  Note that your host firewall have the NFS UDP
ports open, the startup script will give the address and port details
for this.

.. note::

   OSX file system is by default case insensitive, which can confuse
   git.  At the writing of this Cilium repo has no file names that
   would be considered referring to the same file on a case
   insensitive file system.  Regardless, it may be useful to create a
   disk image with a case sensitive file system for holding your git
   repos.

.. note::

   VirtualBox for OSX currently (version 5.1.22) always reports
   host-only networks' prefix length as 64.  Cilium needs this prefix
   to be 16, and the startup script will check for this.  This check
   always fails when using VirtualBox on OSX, but it is safe to let
   the startup script to reset the prefix length to 16.

If for some reason, running of the provisioning script fails, you should bring the VM down before trying again:

::

    $ vagrant halt


Development Cycle
-----------------

The Vagrantfile in the Cilium repo root (hereon just ``Vagrantfile``),
always provisions Cilium build and install when the VM is started.
After the initial build and install you can do further building and
testing incrementally inside the VM. ``vagrant ssh`` takes you to the
Cilium source tree directory
(``/home/vagrant/go/src/github.com/cilium/cilium``) by default, and the
following commands assume that being your current directory.

Build
~~~~~

Assuming you have synced (rsync) the source tree after you have made
changes, or the tree is automatically in sync via NFS or guest
additions folder sharing, you can issue a build as follows:

::
   
    $ make

A successful build should be followed by running the unit tests:

::
   
    $ make tests

Install
~~~~~~~

After a successful build and test you can re-install Cilium by:

::

    $ sudo -E make install

Restart Cilium service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the newly installed version of Cilium, restart the service:

::

    $ sudo service cilium restart

You can verify the service and cilium-agent status by the following
commands, respectively:

::
   
    $ service cilium status
    $ cilium status

.. _testsuite:

Runtime Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Warning::

  Running the testsuite will modify the host environment. If you are using the
  default VM that might not be an issue, but if you are running bare-metal or a
  different VM the tests might fail or worst case remove possibly important
  configuration. Specifically, they are modifying the state and configuration of
  the system including, changes to ``iptables`` configuration, kernel
  configuration via ``sysctl``, adding and removing networking devices, routes,
  etc. via ``iproute2``. Please note this is not meant to be a complete summary,
  but a heads-up if you are planning to run the testsuite somewhere else than in
  the developer VM.

After the new version of Cilium is running, you should run the runtime tests:

::
   
    $ sudo make runtime-tests

Nightly Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Ginkgo <https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/>`_ is used for tests that run at a nightly cadence on Jenkins.

Jenkins Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nightly tests run once per day in the `Cilium-Nightly-Tests Job <https://jenkins.cilium.io/job/Cilium-Nightly-Tests/>`_. 
The configuration for this job is stored in ``Jenkinsfile.nightly``.

To see the results of these tests, you can view the JUnit Report for an individual job:

1. Click on the build number you wish to get test results from on the left hand side of the `Cilium-Nightly-Tests Job <https://jenkins.cilium.io/job/Cilium-Nightly-Tests/>`_. 
2. Click on 'Test Results' on the left side of the page to view the results from the build.
   This will give you a report of which tests passed and failed. You can click on each test
   to view its corresponding output created from Ginkgo. 

Running Nightly Tests Locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To understand more about how Cilium testing works with Ginkgo and to get your environment setup, refer to ``test/readme.md``.

To run the nightly tests locally, run the following command:

::

    $ cd ${TESTDIR}; ginkgo --focus="Nightly*" -v -noColor

The above statement will pick up all tests that are prefixed with "Nightly", e.g.:

::

    var _ = Describe("NightlyK8sEpsMeasurement", func() {

For more information about how to write tests with Ginkgo, we recommend checking the `Ginkgo Documentation <https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/>`_.
We have many examples of tests in the Cilium repository. For instance, you can take a look at is ``test/k8sT/Nightly.go``.

Guidelines for Writing Nightly Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We require and recommend the following when writing tests:

* Your tests should always clean up after themselves (i.e., removing containers / pods, deleting imported policies, and restarting Cilium if configuration changes have been made to the Cilium daemon throughout the tests).
* You should always add informative logs using Ginkgo's `By <https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#documenting-complex-its-by>`_ to describe what is going on during your test. This will make debugging easier for those who have not interacted deeply with the tests if they hit an error.

Further Assistance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Have a question about how the tests work or want to chat more about improving the testing infrastructure for Cilium? Hop on over to the `testing <https://cilium.slack.com/messages/C7PE7V806>`_ channel on Slack. 

Building Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever making changes to Cilium documentation you should check that you did not introduce any new warnings or errors, and also check that your changes look as you intended.  To do this you can build the docs:

::

    $ make -C Documentation html

After this you can browse the updated docs as HTML starting at
``Documentation\_build\html\index.html``.

Alternatively you can use a Docker container to build the pages.

::

    $ docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/srv/ cilium/docs-builder /bin/bash -c 'make html'

This behave similarly to running the ``make`` command above so the path to the
build is the same.

There is also a separate target for building and starting a web server with
your document changes.

::

    $ make render

Now the documentation page should be browsable on http://localhost:8080

Debugging datapath code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    See also the user troubleshooting guide in the section :ref:`admin_guide`.

One of the most common issues when developing datapath code is that the BPF
code cannot be loaded into the kernel. This frequently manifests as the
endpoints appearing in the "not-ready" state and never switching out of it:

.. code:: bash

    $ cilium endpoint list
    ENDPOINT   POLICY        IDENTITY   LABELS (source:key[=value])   IPv6                     IPv4            STATUS
               ENFORCEMENT
    48896      Disabled      266        container:id.server           fd02::c0a8:210b:0:bf00   10.11.13.37     not-ready
    60670      Disabled      267        container:id.client           fd02::c0a8:210b:0:ecfe   10.11.167.158   not-ready

Running ``cilium endpoint get`` for one of the endpoints will provide a
description of known state about it, which includes BPF verification logs.

The files under ``/var/run/cilium/state`` provide context about how the BPF
datapath is managed and set up. The .log files will describe the BPF
requirements and features that Cilium detected and used to generate the BPF
programs. The .h files describe specific configurations used for BPF program
compilation. The numbered directories describe endpoint-specific state,
including header configuration files and BPF binaries.

.. code:: bash

    # for log in /var/run/cilium/state/*.log; do echo "cat $log"; cat $log; done
    cat /var/run/cilium/state/bpf_features.log
    BPF/probes: CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y is not in kernel configuration
    BPF/probes: CONFIG_LWTUNNEL_BPF=y is not in kernel configuration
    HAVE_LPM_MAP_TYPE: Your kernel doesn't support LPM trie maps for BPF, thus disabling CIDR policies. Recommendation is to run 4.11+ kernels.
    HAVE_LRU_MAP_TYPE: Your kernel doesn't support LRU maps for BPF, thus switching back to using hash table for the cilium connection tracker. Recommendation is to run 4.10+ kernels.

Current BPF map state for particular programs is held under ``/sys/fs/bpf/``,
and the `bpf-map <https://github.com/cilium/bpf-map>`_ utility can be useful
for debugging what is going on inside them, for example:

.. code:: bash

    # ls /sys/fs/bpf/tc/globals/

CI / Testing environment
------------------------

Logging into VM running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you have access to credentials for Jenkins, log into the Jenkins slave running the test workload
2. Identify the vagrant box running the specific test

.. code:: bash

    $ vagrant global-status
    id       name                          provider   state   directory

3. Log into the specific VM

.. code:: bash

    $ JOB_BASE_NAME=PR-1588 BUILD_NUMBER=6 vagrant ssh 6e68c6c


Release Process
---------------

Cilium schedules a major release every 3 months. Each major release is
performed by incrementing the `Y` in the version format `X.Y.0`. The group of
committers can decide to increment `X` instead to mark major milestones in
which case `Y` is reset to 0.

The following steps are performed to publish a release:

1. The master branch is set to the version `X.Y.90` at all times. This ensures
   that a development snapshot is considered more recent than a stable release
   at all times.
2. The committers can agree on a series of release candidates which will be
   tagged `vX.Y-rcN` in the master branch.
3. The committers declare the master branch ready for the release and fork the
   master branch into a release branch `vX.Y+1.0`.
4. The first commit in the release branch is to change the version to
   `X.Y+1.0`.
5. The next commit goes into the master branch and sets the version to
   `X.Y+1.90` to ensure that the master branch will be considered more recent
   than any stable release of the major release that is about to be published.

Stable releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The committers can nominate commits pushed to the master as stable release
candidates in which case they will be backported to previous release branches.
Upon necessity, stable releases are published with the version `X.Y.Z+1`.

Criteria for the inclusion into stable release branches are:

- Security relevant fixes
- Major bugfixes relevant to the correct operation of Cilium

Developer's Certificate of Origin
---------------------------------

To improve tracking of who did what, we've introduced a "sign-off"
procedure.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
commit, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as open-source work. The rules are pretty simple: if you can
certify the below:
