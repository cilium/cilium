// Package eppolicymap represents the map from an endpoint ID to its
// policy map. This map is of type BPF_MAP_TYPES_HASH_OF_MAPS where
// as noted above the key is the endpoint ID. It is used to lookup
// the policy from the socket context where unlike in the L2/L3 context,
// where the program has a direct lookup of the policy because each
// program is attached to an endpoint, socket programs run on all sockets
// regardless of endpoint.
