// Event currently wraps fsnotify.Event
type Event fsnotify.Event

// Watcher is a wrapper around fsnotify.Watcher which can track non-existing
// files and emit creation events for them. All files which are supposed to be
// tracked need to passed to the New constructor.
//   1) If the file already exists, the watcher will emit write, chmod, remove
//      and rename events for the file (same as fsnotify).
//   2) If the file does not yet exist, then the Watcher makes sure to watch
//      the appropriate parent folder instead. Once the file is created, this
//      watcher will emit a creation event for the tracked file and enter
//      case 1.
//   3) If the file already exists, but is removed, then a remove event is
//      emitted and we enter case 2.
//
// Special care has to be taken around symlinks. Support for symlink is
// limited, but it supports the following cases in order to support
// Kubernetes volume mounts:
//   1) If the tracked file is a symlink, then the watcher will emit write,
//      chmod, remove and rename events for the *target* of the symlink.
//   2) If a tracked file is a symlink and the symlink target is removed,
//      then the remove event is emitted and the watcher tries to re-resolve
//      the symlink target. If the new target exists, a creation event is
//      emitted and we enter case 1). If the new target does not exist, an
//      error is emitted and the path will not be watched anymore.
//
// Most notably, if a tracked file is a symlink, any update of the symlink
// itself does not emit an event. Only if the target of the symlink observes
// an event is the symlink re-evaluated.
