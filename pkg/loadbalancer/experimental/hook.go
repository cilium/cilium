// can manipulate the frontend before the changes are seen by other components.
//
// The main use-case for a hook is to set e.g. L7 proxy port before the frontend
// is reconciled and thus avoid unnecessary work.
//
// For consistency the hook should only access StateDB tables via the provided
// read transaction.
