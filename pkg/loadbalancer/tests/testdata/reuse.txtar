# Test the reuse of a ClusterIP. Validates that we process the changes
# in services in the right order even though the reflector is batching
# events.
#
# This tests for the regression where the events were processed
# in the wrong order, e.g. the creation of a new service before the deletion
# of the old service, leading to "frontend already owned by another service"
# error. Triggered easily with stress.sh:
#
#  === NAME  TestScript
#    logger.go:256: ... msg="Failure processing services" error="frontend already owned by another service ..."
#    ...
