<a name="istio-workload-Address"></a>

### Address
Address represents a unique address.

Address joins two sub-resources, Workload and Service, to support querying by IP address.
Address is intended to be able to be looked up on-demand, allowing a client
to answer a question like &#34;what is this IP address&#34;, similar to a reverse DNS lookup.

Each resource will have a mesh-wide unique opaque name, defined in the individual messages.
In addition, to support lookup by IP address, they will have *alias* names for each IP the resource represents.
There may be multiple aliases for the same resource (examples: service in multiple networks, or a dual-stack workload).
Aliases are keyed by network/IP address. Example: &#34;default/1.2.3.4&#34;.

In some cases, we do not know the IP address of a Workload. For instance, we may simply know
that there is a workload behind a gateway, and rely on the gateway to handle the rest.
In this case, the key format will be &#34;resource-uid&#34;. The resource can be a Pod, WorkloadEntry, etc.
These resources cannot be looked up on-demand.

In some cases, we do not know the IP address of a Service. These services cannot be used for matching
outbound traffic, as we only have L4 attributes to route based on. However,
they can be used for Gateways.
In this case, the key format will be &#34;network/hostname&#34;.
These resources cannot be looked up on-demand.

### Workload
Workload represents a workload - an endpoint (or collection behind a hostname).
The xds primary key is &#34;uid&#34; as defined on the workload below.
Secondary (alias) keys are the unique `network/IP` pairs that the workload can be reached at.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| uid | [string](#string) |  | UID represents a globally unique opaque identifier for this workload. For k8s resources, it is recommended to use the more readable format:

cluster/group/kind/namespace/name/section-name

As an example, a ServiceEntry with two WorkloadEntries inlined could become two Workloads with the following UIDs: - cluster1/networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/ServiceEntry/default/external-svc/endpoint1 - cluster1/networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/ServiceEntry/default/external-svc/endpoint2

For VMs and other workloads other formats are also supported; for example, a single UID string: &#34;0ae5c03d-5fb3-4eb9-9de8-2bd4b51606ba&#34; |
| name | [string](#string) |  | Name represents the name for the workload. For Kubernetes, this is the pod name. This is just for debugging and may be elided as an optimization. |
| namespace | [string](#string) |  | Namespace represents the namespace for the workload. This is just for debugging and may be elided as an optimization. |
| addresses | [bytes](#bytes) | repeated | Address represents the IPv4/IPv6 address for the workload. This should be globally unique. This should not have a port number. Each workload must have at least either an address or hostname; not both. |
| hostname | [string](#string) |  | The hostname for the workload to be resolved by the ztunnel. DNS queries are sent on-demand by default. If the resolved DNS query has several endpoints, the request will be forwarded to the first response.

At a minimum, each workload must have either an address or hostname. For example, a workload that backs a Kubernetes service will typically have only endpoints. A workload that backs a headless Kubernetes service, however, will have both addresses as well as a hostname used for direct access to the headless endpoint. |
| network | [string](#string) |  | Network represents the network this workload is on. This may be elided for the default network. A (network,address) pair makeup a unique key for a workload *at a point in time*. |
| tunnel_protocol | [TunnelProtocol](#istio-workload-TunnelProtocol) |  | Protocol that should be used to connect to this workload. |
| trust_domain | [string](#string) |  | The SPIFFE identity of the workload. The identity is joined to form spiffe://&lt;trust_domain&gt;/ns/&lt;namespace&gt;/sa/&lt;service_account&gt;. TrustDomain of the workload. May be elided if this is the mesh wide default (typically cluster.local) |
| service_account | [string](#string) |  | ServiceAccount of the workload. May be elided if this is &#34;default&#34; |
| waypoint | [GatewayAddress](#istio-workload-GatewayAddress) |  | If present, the waypoint proxy for this workload. All incoming requests must go through the waypoint. |
| network_gateway | [GatewayAddress](#istio-workload-GatewayAddress) |  | If present, East West network gateway this workload can be reached through. Requests from remote networks should traverse this gateway. |
| node | [string](#string) |  | Name of the node the workload runs on |
| canonical_name | [string](#string) |  | CanonicalName for the workload. Used for telemetry. |
| canonical_revision | [string](#string) |  | CanonicalRevision for the workload. Used for telemetry. |
| workload_type | [WorkloadType](#istio-workload-WorkloadType) |  | WorkloadType represents the type of the workload. Used for telemetry. |
| workload_name | [string](#string) |  | WorkloadName represents the name for the workload (of type WorkloadType). Used for telemetry. |
| native_tunnel | [bool](#bool) |  | If set, this indicates a workload expects to directly receive tunnel traffic. In ztunnel, this means: * Requests *from* this workload do not need to be tunneled if they already are tunneled by the tunnel_protocol. * Requests *to* this workload, via the tunnel_protocol, do not need to be de-tunneled. |
| application_tunnel | [ApplicationTunnel](#istio-workload-ApplicationTunnel) |  | If an application, such as a sandwiched waypoint proxy, supports directly receiving information from zTunnel they can set application_protocol. |
| services | [Workload.ServicesEntry](#istio-workload-Workload-ServicesEntry) | repeated | The services for which this workload is an endpoint. The key is the NamespacedHostname string of the format namespace/hostname. |
| authorization_policies | [string](#string) | repeated | A list of authorization policies applicable to this workload. NOTE: this *only* includes Selector based policies. Namespace and global polices are returned out of band. Authorization policies are only valid for workloads with `addresses` rather than `hostname`. |
| status | [WorkloadStatus](#istio-workload-WorkloadStatus) |  |  |
| cluster_id | [string](#string) |  | The cluster ID that the workload instance belongs to |
| locality | [Locality](#istio-workload-Locality) |  | The Locality defines information about where a workload is geographically deployed |
| network_mode | [NetworkMode](#istio-workload-NetworkMode) |  |  |
| extensions | [Extension](#istio-workload-Extension) | repeated | Extension provides a mechanism to attach arbitrary additional configuration to an object. |
| capacity | [google.protobuf.UInt32Value](#google-protobuf-UInt32Value) |  | Capacity for this workload. This represents the amount of traffic the workload can handle, relative to other workloads If unset, the capacity is default to 1. |

### LoadBalancing.Mode


| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| UNSPECIFIED_MODE | 0 |  |
| STRICT | 1 | In STRICT mode, only endpoints that meets all of the routing preferences will be considered. This can be used, for instance, to keep traffic ONLY within the same cluster/node/region. This should be used with caution, as it can result in all traffic being dropped if there is no matching endpoints, even if there are endpoints outside of the preferences. |
| FAILOVER | 2 | In FAILOVER mode, endpoint selection will prefer endpoints that match all preferences, but failover to groups of endpoints that match less (or, eventually, none) preferences. For instance, with `[NETWORK, REGION, ZONE]`, we will send to: 1. Endpoints matching `[NETWORK, REGION, ZONE]` 2. Endpoints matching `[NETWORK, REGION]` 3. Endpoints matching `[NETWORK]` 4. Any endpoints |

### TunnelProtocol
TunnelProtocol indicates the tunneling protocol for requests.

| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| NONE | 0 | NONE means requests should be forwarded as-is, without tunneling. |
| HBONE | 1 | HBONE means requests should be tunneled over HTTP. This does not dictate HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2; ALPN should be used for that purpose.
