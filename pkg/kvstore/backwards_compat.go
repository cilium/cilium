// deleteLegacyPrefixes removes old kvstore prefixes of non-persistent keys
// which have been used in the past but have been obsoleted since. We remove
// them on agent start to ensure that as users upgrade, we do not leave behind
// stale keys
//
// Rules:
//  - For non-persistent state, obsoletd prefixes can be deleted as soon as the
//    prefix has been declared obsolete
//
//  - For persistent configuration stored in the kvstore, a forward upgrade
//    path must be created which automatically removes the old keys on successful
//    translation.
