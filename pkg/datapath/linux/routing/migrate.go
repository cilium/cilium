// MigrateENIDatapath migrates the egress rules inside the Linux routing policy
// database (RPDB) for ENI IPAM mode. It will return the number of rules that
// were successfully migrated and the number of rules we've failed to migrated.
// A -1 is returned for the failed number of rules if we couldn't even start
// the migration.
//
// The compat flag will control what Cilium will do in the migration process.
// If the flag is false, this instructs Cilium to ensure the datapath is newer
// (or v2). If the flag is true, Cilium will ensure the original datapath (v1)
// is in-place.
//
// Because this migration is on a best-effort basis, we ensure that each rule
// (or endpoint), at the end, has either the new datapath or the original
// in-place and serviceable. Otherwise we risk breaking connectivity.
//
// We rely on the ability to fetch the CiliumNode resource because we need to
// fetch the number associated with the ENI device. The CiliumNode resource
// contains this information in the Status field. This fetch is abstracted away
// in the (*migrator).getter interface to avoid bringing in K8s logic to this
// low-level datapath code.
//
// This function should be invoked before any endpoints are created.
// Concretely, this function should be invoked before exposing the Cilium API
// and health initialization logic because we want to ensure that no workloads
// are scheduled while this modification is taking place. This migration is
// related to a bug (https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/14336) where an
// ENI has an ifindex that equals the main routing table number (253-255),
// causing the rules and routes to be created using the wrong table ID, which
// could end up blackholing most traffic on the node.

	// associated with the endpoint).
	//
	// In both the upgrade and downgrade scenario, the following happens in a
	// specific order to guarantee that any failure at any point won't cause
	// connectivity disruption for the endpoint. Any errors encountered do not
	// stop the migration process because we want to ensure that we conform to
	// either the new state or the old state, and want to avoid being
	// in-between datapath states.
	//   1) Copy over new routes from the old routes
	//   2) Insert new rule
	//   3) Delete old rule
	//   4) Delete old routes
	// Doing (1) & (2) before (3) & (4) allows us to essentially perform an
	// "atomic" swap-in for the new state.
	//
	// (4) is attempted separately outside the main loop because we want to
	// avoid deleting routes for endpoints that share the same table ID. We
	// will delete the routes, if and only if, all endpoints that share the
	// same table ID succeeded in migrating. If an endpoint failed to migrate,
	// then any routes that reference the table ID associated with the
	// endpoint's egress rule will be skipped. This is to prevent disrupting
	// endpoints who relying on the old state to be in-place.
	//
	// If a failure occurs at (1), then the old state can continue to service
	// the endpoint. Similarly with (2) because routes without rules are likely
	// to not have any effect.
	//
	// If a failure occurs at (3), we have already succeeded in getting the new
	// state in-place to direct traffic for the endpoint. In any case of
	// upgrade or downgrade, it is possible for both states to be in-place if
	// there are any failures, especially if there were any failures in
	// reverting. The datapath selected will depend on the rule priority.
	//
	// Concretely, for upgrades, the newer rule will have a lower priority, so
	// the original datapath will be selected. The migration is deemed a
	// failure because the original datapath (with a rule that has a higher
	// priority) is being selected for the endpoint. It is necessary to attempt
	// reverting the failed migration work [(1) & (2)], as leaving the state
	// could block a user's from retrying this upgrade again.
	//
	// For downgrades, the newer rule will have a higher priority, so the newer
	// datapath will be selected. The migration is deemed a success and we
	// explicitly avoid reverting, because it's not necessary to revert this
	// work merely because we failed to cleanup old, ineffectual state.
	//
	// In either case, no connectivity is affected for the endpoint.
	//
	// If we fail at (4), then the old rule will have been deleted and the new
	// state is in-place, which would be servicing the endpoint. The old routes
	// would just be leftover state to be cleaned up at a later point.
	//
	// It is also important to note that we only revert what we've done on a
	// per-rule basis if we fail at (2) or (3). This is by design because we
	// want to ensure that each iteration of the loop is atomic to each
