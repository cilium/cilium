// ran). It is guaranteed that no events will be scheduled onto an EventQueue
// after it has been closed; if any event is attempted to be scheduled onto an
// EventQueue after it has been closed, it will be cancelled immediately. For
// any event to be processed by the EventQueue, it must implement the
