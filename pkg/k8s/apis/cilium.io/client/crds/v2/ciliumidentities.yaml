        description: "CiliumIdentity is a CRD that represents an identity managed
          by Cilium. It is intended as a backing store for identity allocation, acting
          as the global coordination backend, and can be used in place of a KVStore
          (such as etcd). The name of the CRD is the numeric identity and the labels
          on the CRD object are the kubernetes sourced labels seen by cilium. This
          is currently the only label source possible when running under kubernetes.
          Non-kubernetes labels are filtered but all labels, from all sources, are
          places in the SecurityLabels field. These also include the source and are
          used to define the identity. The labels under metav1.ObjectMeta can be used
          when searching for CiliumIdentity instances that include particular labels.
          This can be done with invocations such as: \n \tkubectl get ciliumid -l
          'foo=bar'"
