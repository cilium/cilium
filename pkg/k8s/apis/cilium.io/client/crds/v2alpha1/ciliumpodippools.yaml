                  `ipam.cilium.io/*` annotation.

                  The selector can match on regular Pod labels and on the following synthetic
                  labels that Cilium adds for convenience:

                  io.kubernetes.pod.namespace – the Pod's namespace
                  io.kubernetes.pod.name      – the Pod's name

                  A single Pod must not match more than one pool for the same IP family.
                  If multiple pools match, IP allocation fails for that Pod and a warning event
                  is emitted in the namespace of the Pod.
