# Cilium incremental build. Should be fast given builder-deps is up-to-date!
#
# cilium-builder tag is the date on which the compatible build image
# was pushed.  If a new version of the build image is needed, it needs
# to be tagged with a new date and this file must be changed
# accordingly.  Keeping the old images available will allow older
# versions to be built while allowing the new versions to make changes
# that are not backwards compatible.

# BUILDPLATFORM note: BUILDPLATFORM is an automatic platform ARG enabled by
# Docker BuildKit. The form we would want to use to enable cross-platform builds
# is "--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM". This would break classic builds, as they would
# see just "--platform=", which causes an invalid argument error.
# Makefile.buildkit detects the "# FROM ..." comment on the previous line and
# augments the FROM line accordingly.
