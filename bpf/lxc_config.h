/* It appears that we can support around the below number of prefixes in an

 * the logic in the datapath, hence the defines below. This number was arrived
 * to by adjusting the number of prefixes and running:
 *
 *    $ make -C bpf && sudo test/bpf/verifier-test.sh
 *
 *  If you're from a future where all supported kernels include LPM map type,
